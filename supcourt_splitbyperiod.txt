We will now hear argument in the Cherokee Nation against Thompson and Thompson against the Cherokee Nation.
Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: These two contract cases concern whether the Government is liable in money damages under the Contract Disputes Act and section 110 of the Indian Self-Determination Act when the Secretary fails to fully pay a contract price for the.
Would you mind explaining to us how these two cases relate?
The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision went one way and the Tenth Circuit went another.
And are the claims at all overlapping?
How are they differentiated?
No, Justice O'Connor.
They're they're not overlapping.
The claims in the Federal Circuit case involved three contracts covering fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996.
And the Cherokee contract at issue in the case that went through the Tenth Circuit is fiscal year 1997 contract and funding agreement.
The section remedial section of the act, section 110.
But they're certainly at odds on the legal theory.
Yes, they are, Your Honor.
The Federal Circuit applied standard, bedrock Government contracting law, primarily the rule that when a contract payment is conditioned on there being an appropriation, the payment right vests in full once the appropriation is enacted by Congress.
And secondly, the court ruled that the Indian Self-Determination Act does not bar the payment of the contracts in this case under the circumstances presented.
And to the contrary.
We submit that the Secretary's construction of that clause would undo the act, would undo section 106(b) of the act.
Are the circumstances any different in the two situations, the Cherokee Nation case and the one in the Federal Circuit?
Are are the circumstances, giving rise to the claim, different in any respect that could account for a difference in outcome?
No, Justice O'Connor.
There there is no difference in that respect, and there is an overlap in in this sense.
The Shoshone-Paiute contract that arose through the Tenth Circuit case did involve fiscal year 1996, the same fiscal year as the Cherokee contract that covered fiscal year 1996.
So in that sense, both cases involved the the same relevant issues.
The the key, we think, to the resolution of the act is found in the act on page 12a of the appendix to our opening blue brief.
The act was amended in this section twice, in 1988 and in 1994, for three reasons: to secure contract funding, to reduce the Federal bureaucracy, and to eliminate secretarial funding discretion over contract funding issues.
In section 12a, 450j-1(a), the bottom half of the page, it is stated in subparagraph (1) that the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall not be less than the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided.
And then directly pertinent to this case is subparagraph (2), which directs which addresses contract support costs.
There shall be added to the amount required by paragraph (1) contract support costs which shall consist of certain items.
Incidentally, these items typically cover the cost of insurance, audit costs, procurement costs that might otherwise be administered for the Government by the Office of Personnel Management or personnel costs that might otherwise be administered by the Office of Personnel Management.
Does the do the actual contracts reduce the the CSC's to a dollar amount or.
Yes, they do.
So so we know they they knew at the moment the contract was signed what it was going to cost.
That is correct, Justice Souter.
In the case of the Shoshone-Paiute contract, when the parties decided to renegotiate the contract amount, they entered into an amendment to specify the new, updated contract amount.
I don't want to get ahead of you in taking us through the statute, so you can defer the question if if you choose.
But it seems to me relevant to (a).
Does is is part of the submission that the Government used some of the funds that otherwise would have gone to you for its own monitoring and of of health contracts and that that's what's in dispute?
Or was it just general overhead for other programs it used?
It it is precisely, Justice Kennedy, what what you stated.
In fact, we can turn directly to page 14a.
I I stated an or.
I what I I stated at the outset?
The the Government took money for its own Federal functions instead of including contract monitoring.
Including contract monitoring.
Including contract monitoring.
Including contract monitoring.
In fact, they say so in their brief and and defend that action.
The the sections on page 12a and 13a articulate in quite a lot of detail the nature of the contract support costs that must be added.
These are strange contracts, of course, aren't they?
I mean, are there any other contracts that the Government has to enter into?
I mean, the Secretary has to give these tribes the authority to take over, in effect, implementation of the of a Federal health program, doesn't he?
That is correct, Justice Scalia.
Well, I why would you expect that this strange kind of contract should should, prima facie, be governed by the same rules as to appropriations as other contracts.
where where an agency, having due regard to how much money is appropriated, will limit the number of contracts it enters into?
But but here you're creating a situation where the agency has to contract and yet has no control over having enough money to to meet the contractual obligations.
It seems to me a a strange way to run a railroad.
It it is a unique contractual situation, Justice Scalia, but one that Congress fully anticipated.
And and I would explain it this way.
First of all, there is the Contract Disputes Act which Congress said applies to these contracts.
The contracts were so unique that prior to 1988, the Interior Board of Contract Appeals, in a decision called the Busby case, had ruled that these contracts could not be enforced under the Contract Disputes Act precisely for the reason Justice Scalia articulated.
Congress changed that.
In 1988, Congress amended section 110 of the act, reproduced at the bottom of page 26a, and gave the Court of Claims, then the Court of Claims, and the district courts concurrent jurisdiction over money damages claims under the Contract Disputes Act.
And the legislative history explains that Congress did this precisely to overcome the Busby decision and to make these contracts enforceable for the stated contract price.
But further to Justice Scalia's point, don't the contracts in question themselves contain clauses that say this is not a procurement contract?
The the procurement contract that is correct.
Not the contracts themselves, Your Honor.
The the act says that.
Oh, the act says that they're not procurement contracts.
the contracts are not procurement contracts, Justice Kennedy.
That's correct.
These contracts began as procurement contracts.
They had been procurement contracts, and even still, they were not enforced under the Court of the Interior Board of Contract Appeals decision in the Busby decision.
Congress relieved the contractors of the procurement system because they felt that the agency had built up an enormous contract monitoring bureaucracy which it wanted to eliminate.
And for that reason, it eliminated the procurement rules in the hopes that the contract monitoring bureaucracy would be eliminated along with it.
Miller, do.
Justice Ginsburg.
on on the interpretation you've just explained to us, does that mean that the Secretary has no authority under this statute or generally to reserve some portion of this for what you call Federal functions, that it every penny of the appropriation could go to the costs of this contract and nothing left in the till for the so-called Federal functions?
Justice Ginsburg, I I would put my answer in this context.
There are many sources from which the Government could have reprogrammed to pay these contracts.
It could have been, yes, as we submit, from the funds spent on Federal functions and secretarial administration.
It could have been from the up to $88 million increases Congress was making every year.
It could have been from the up to $98 million in leftover appropriations the agencies had every year, and it could have been from the regional and headquarters offices that the agencies had where they don't administer services.
But your your answer is, yes, if it came to that, they.
That's the duty Congress imposed upon the Secretary.
The Secretary was free not to reprogram.
That's that's a choice the Secretary had and the Secretary made it.
The question is what are the ramifications of that choice and we submit.
Well, let me ask you another question related.
Suppose this is an individual action.
These are individual actions.
They're not class actions.
Correct, Your Honor.
Do the ones who come to court to sue get paid in full even though there may be many other self-determination contracts out there, and that if you gave them all their fair share, none of them would be paid in full?
Does it just depend on first come to court, first served, and the less litigious are just out of luck?
Your Honor, we we do not believe that that that should be the outcome.
That would advantage the contractors that came forward and not take account of the entire situation.
We think the global situation has to be looked at.
The total amount of the contracts that were not paid in fiscal year 1994.
I mean, you can't get blood out of a turnip.
I mean, Justice Ginsburg is asking the question, what if there is not enough money to go around?
If there were only sufficient money to pay half of the contract shortfalls.
without violating the clause and the Secretary had the discretion not to reduce appropriations, or he could, for programs serving other tribes, and then the tribes would only be entitled to half of the shortfall, if there was only a sufficient amount of money.
Didn't the tribes get notice they might not get the full amount of the the CSC, and so they had ample opportunity to cut back on their spending?
No, Justice Kennedy, and and to the contrary.
In fiscal year 1994, the Indian Health Service was telling everybody they were paying them in full.
They told the General Accounting Office they paid everybody in full on page 32 of the GAO report cited in the Government's brief.
So these these are reliance damages in a sense.
The the tribes expected to be paid.
The Shoshone-Paiute tribes were told they would be paid in full in the first year.
I mean, they they were out of pocket for money they spent before they knew, other than the statutory notice they had, that they wouldn't get the full amount?
That is correct.
That is correct.
Well, when do the tribal contractors know how much money the Government actually will have available to spend?
The contractors don't know until the year is over because throughout the year, the Government reserves the power, although not exercised, but stated in a circular, to reprogram.
And the appropriations.
What what do you mean by that?
You said a second ago the Secretary had the option to reprogram.
What do you mean by reprogram?
When the Secretary prepares a budget to the Congress, it states usually a lump sum amount of, say, $1.
8 billion.
We we take $400 million off the top or $300 million off the top because that was specified by Congress for certain purposes.
But the balance is a lump sum.
The Secretary crafts a budget.
The budget is not adopted by Congress, just a dollar amount is adopted by Congress.
Now, Congress can step in and take a particular item and earmark that item and cap it if it chooses, but it didn't do that in these years.
Yes, but the the tribes have to enter contracts not knowing how much money is going to be there at the end of the day?
The tribes enter into contracts, as most Government contractors do when they enter into contracts before an appropriation is made, not knowing if the agency will have the money to pay them.
That's okay.
The problem is when the statute says it's subject to the availability of appropriations and Congress enacts the appropriations.
It's been the law for 120 years that at that point, the right to payment vests and the tribe is entitled to be paid.
All right.
So how was that appropriation money in fact used by the Federal Government, do you say?
The Federal Government.
There was the appropriation.
And the tribes had already entered into contracts.
Now, how was that lump sum used?
The agency then, under this Court's teaching in Lincoln v.
Vigil, has complete discretion over how it spends its appropriation except insofar as.
Is that what you mean by programming?
Yes, thank you, Justice Souter, for taking me back to your question.
What we mean is that the Secretary submits a budget, but the budget is not binding on the Secretary.
It's not binding as a matter of law because Congress didn't adopt it.
And as conditions change over the course of the year, the agency readjusts its budget, which we call reprogramming.
So programming is allocating various segments of the lump sum to various purposes.
And the Secretary retains complete discretion as this Court taught.
And is that done without regard to the contract amounts that the tribes have entered into?
Well, it should not be done without regard to the contract amounts.
Is that in fact how it was done?
That is in fact how it was done.
And is it still done that way?
Well, the times have changed.
Since 1998, fiscal year 1998, Congress has imposed caps on the contracts and court costs that the agency has.
So there's no question the agency cannot pay more than Congress gives it.
When Congress only gives it $100 million or $200 million for contract support costs, that's it.
The Secretary cannot be sued for failing to pay more.
But didn't didn't Congress, even before that, impose a significant limitation on how much the Secretary could pay?
What do you with the provision in in (b) of of the section that you were reading from?
Notwithstanding any other provision in this subchapter, the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and the Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe or tribal organization under this chapter.
I mean, what what money that the Secretary expends is is not expended for programs, projects, or activities that serve a tribe?
Justice Scalia, we read this this clause with keeping in mind the first sentence first of the sentence.
The first sentence, which begins on the preceding page, page 14a, says that the amount of funds required by subsection (a), (1) shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract monitoring or administration by the Secretary.
And the subparagraph (3) in the middle of page 15a, shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions.
Well, that's all very good, but.
But then there's an exception.
then the last paragraph begins with the word notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter.
So this.
it seems to me, overrides everything else.
Unless unless you can persuade me that that that that provision doesn't give the Secretary the authority to to allocate the available funds among other activities that serve tribes, I I think it trumps whatever else you appeal to.
Justice Scalia, for for two reasons we think it cannot.
First of all, if that exception swallowed up the rule set forth in the first sentence, it would defeat the whole purpose of the act.
And more, in the statute on page 21, there is a mandatory rule of construction that Congress has articulated which, interestingly enough, the Government never cites in the statutory interpretation case.
And this rule says on page 21, 1(a)(2), each provision of the act.
Page sorry.
21 of.
21a of our opening blue brief.
Okay, 21a, good.
21a, correct.
Each provision of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act and each provision of this contract shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the contractor.
That statement is repeated as well in every.
Oh, fine, but you still have to look at that last sentence in subsection (b) and grapple with what it means.
The Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe.
So what could it mean?
That's our challenge.
Now, what does it mean?
We have to give it meaning.
We believe it means the as the Secretary always said when and and said at the time these amendments were adopted in 1988, that's services on the ground, the hospitals and clinics.
If I walked into the office of the headquarters of the Indian Health Service in Rockville, Maryland, I'm not going to see doctors and nurses in white jackets.
I'm not going to see patients and counselors.
There aren't programs serving tribes in these headquarters offices, and in these area offices, large portions of what they do are administrative functions.
All right.
May may I interrupt you there?
And tell me if I understand the the position in your brief correctly.
I thought the position that you took there was ultimately regardless of what the notwithstanding clause means, there's enough money to pay all the contracts in the appropriation that is actually made.
And if any money is going to be squeezed, the person who's going to be squeezed or the is the is the agency itself.
Its bureaucracy is going to have less money.
And I understood your argument to be that given the provisions you read earlier in this section, Congress has made a positive decision that if there's a choice between paying the contract amounts and squeezing the bureaucracy, the bureaucracy gets squeezed.
Is that your position?
That is our position.
If that is your position, do you have to even grapple with difficulties about the notwithstanding clause?
Well, we still need to provide some meaning to the to the provision that says the Secretary may not does not have to reduce funding for programs serving other tribes.
I guess, I think we do need to grapple with the clause in order not to.
But but I thought you were saying you could you could the the Secretary doesn't have to reduce funding for other tribes.
The Secretary can pay the full contract costs, and if anybody is going to get the short end, it's going to be the bureaucracy.
It's going to be the bureaucracy.
Just give them the just give them the money.
It's not going to be the programs on the ground serving the tribes.
It's going to be the bureaucracy.
Now, it may be felt.
To put it this is a competition between two bureaucracies, the tribal bureaucracy that is administering the program and the Secretary's bureaucracy which is administering the program of programs.
I mean, it's it's not as though it's a bureaucracy against the people.
The whole purpose of this was to turn over the bureaucratic management of these programs from Government bureaucrats to tribal bureaucrats.
I mean, it.
Well, I would I would.
you you paint it as though the you know, who cares about the bureaucrats.
The the Government just wasn't interested in the bureaucrats.
That may well be, but there there are bureaucrats at both ends of this thing.
I say that for two reasons.
First of all, the the Congress, in our opinion, clearly privileged the tribal contracts over the Secretary's Federal functions.
But more practically, let's look at the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes.
They took over a hospital that had a $5 million budget in round numbers, and the contract support costs requirement was $2 million.
So the contract was in round numbers $7 million.
So they get the hospital, $5 million to run it.
They don't get the $2 million.
Now, they have $3 million to run the hospital.
It's not that they didn't get their bureaucracy.
They didn't get the full hospital operational budget because they had to pay the fixed costs of carrying insurance, undertaking the audits required by Federal law.
There were actual reductions in services so severe, in fact, that the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe nearly lost accreditation.
Can I ask you a basic question.
Yes, Justice Breyer.
which maybe others understand, but I'm confused.
Imagine that this has nothing to do with Indians.
It is simply an ordinary contract.
Now, my understanding is that ordinary contracts say subject to appropriations.
So we have to decide was there an appropriation.
In our imaginary department of Government, the appropriation is $1 billion.
Nothing is earmarked for anything.
They enter into contracts that amount to $999 million.
Now, they pay out $990 million, and their what the department says is, look, everybody knows we need at least $10 million to run our central bureaucracy.
So there's no valid contract here.
The appropriation wasn't made.
Now, my understanding of ordinary Government contract law is to decide whether that $10 million was in principle available for the contracts.
You look to something called the purpose-time-amount test.
So was it during the same time?
Is it in an appropriate amount?
But is it available for this purpose?
Ah, I'm not sure.
All right.
Now, I want if I have the the theory of it right, I want you to tell me what the money was in your case that is the equivalent of the $10 million in my example that you believe in principle was available to pay these for this Indian expenditure.
Just pretend it's a regular contract.
What is the equivalent of that $10 million?
The equivalent of the $10 million would be sums not spent on anything.
in this case, up to $100 million.
Yes, okay.
And anything else?
Any of the increases, any of the sums.
And then we move to this statute.
Well, forget this statute for a second because I'll stop you there.
I want you to tell me why those sums I get the time.
I get the amount.
Why the purpose.
Explain to me why it is one of the purposes for which those appropriations were made, i.
, the equivalent of the $10 million, to go pay for this.
Well, that's one of the things the the Government and we agree upon.
It was one of the purposes.
One of the purposes was paying contracts, and that's because in this act, the appropriation says here's $1.
4 billion or $1.
8 billion to carry out the Indian Self-Determination Act.
So that satisfies the purpose test.
All right.
So you think you and the Government agree then that were this an ordinary contract case, there is no doubt that a legally binding contract would have been entered into and the clause, subject to appropriations, would not work for the Government.
That is correct, Your Honor.
Well, you can't say that the Government agrees to that.
You certainly agree to it.
No, no.
Were it an ordinary.
The Government.
were it an ordinary contract.
In in the hypothetical.
I think the Government would agree that the rule of Ferris and Blackhawk, the Dougherty rule from the Court of Claims, 1983, all stand for the proposition when you sign a contract with the Government and a lump sum appropriation comes, it's not your job to start monitoring Government operations and figuring out how much do they want to boost their functions for this or that or the other, and the.
So our issue as far as you're concerned and I'll ask the Government the same question is, is this contract different from an ordinary contract because of A, B, C, D Indian reservations, et cetera?
And your claim is, I can't find any difference.
And their claim is there will be some difference.
Is that right?
That is correct.
They claim these aren't contracts Justice Kennedy.
Well, you did say the these contracts were unique.
These contracts are unique.
The contracts in Winstar were unique.
The contracts in the United States v.
New Mexico advance costs advance funded cost reimbursable contracts.
Many contracts are unique.
The question is whether the distinction makes a difference in the law.
The distinction here that these are not procurement contracts, that can't be decisive.
Well, the Government says it's unique because the tribes are providing governmental services.
It doesn't really cite us a case where, say, a city or a subdivision has sued under a contract.
But that's not unique either because the the Government, the Department of Defense in Iraq contracts out governmental services, the provision of food to our troops in Iraq.
That's a quintessential governmental services, feeding the military.
But they contract it out.
No one would suggest there that just because it's a governmental service, it qualifies that contract as a lesser contract than any other contract.
Well, they didn't contract it out to the government of Iraq.
They contracted it out to a private contractor.
I mean, what what makes this unique is that the whole purpose of it was to give these these tribes more governmental power, more self-determination.
The whole purpose was to enable the tribes to act as governments.
And even Congress considered.
That's that's what makes it different from private contracts.
even even with Halliburton.
I mean, Halliburton is not an Indian tribe and doesn't purport to be governing anybody.
We submit that that difference was considered by Congress.
In the 1988 amendments, there's even language that says, we're thinking about maybe calling this an intergovernmental agreement, but we've decided to call it a contract because we want it to be enforceable as a contract, just as other Government contracts for goods and services are enforced.
And that was the language of the of the Senate report.
They then imposed the Contract Disputes Act and provided a remedy in money damages.
In those respects, along with the canon of construction, we believe that these contracts are fully enforceable for the stated contract amount.
I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, Justice Stevens.
Thank you.
Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Apart from the roughly 2 percent of the annual lump sum appropriation that the Secretary withheld for performance of those core agency functions that the agency itself was required to perform, the Secretary allocated the entire remaining 98 percent of its lump sum appropriation among tribes.
Now, the tribes have to point to some source of funding within that lump sum appropriation.
Well, they just did, the 2 percent.
So my question to you is the same.
I asked, let's imagine this had nothing to do with tribes, nothing to do with it.
It was a typical, ordinary Government contract for pencils.
All right?
Or for soda water.
Now, and everything were the same.
Under those circumstances, just an ordinary contract and they point to that 2 percent and they say that is legally speaking we didn't expect you to pay it.
We just won a lawsuit in the Court of Claims.
But but we have we have a contract here.
That's what we're just saying.
The the subject to appropriation clause doesn't nix the contract because that 2 percent is available, legally speaking, time, purpose, and and amount.
Now, what's the Government's view there?
Is it available or not were this an ordinary contract?
With respect to the 2 percent that's reserved for inherent Federal functions, that's not available.
I'm asking all right.
Are is the Government's view then let's treat this just as an ordinary contract?
Still it there was no money available.
With respect to.
Legally speaking under the time-purpose-amount test.
Well, Justice Breyer, I'm drawing a distinction between the 2 percent that's reserved for core agency functions and.
it's been a background principle of Government contracting law that there are certain core agency functions that that the Government is required to perform for itself and that it can't contract out.
So I think that informs the interpretation of the subject to availability clause.
Now, I would like an answer to my question, yes or no.
If this were an ordinary contract with a subject to appropriations clause, is would the Government be saying this is invalid because the appropriations were not there?
Well, you have to look at the particular context.
There must be a yes or no answer to that.
It would be no if this statutory regime governed, Justice Breyer.
What it is is a contract for pencils.
Can you not is it impossible.
If if all.
to make you see what I'm driving.
If if all that's at issue is a standard subject to availability clause in a contract and there were no reduction clause, as there is in this statute, and you're dealing with the standard procurement context, then there is a Court of Claims decision, the Blackhawk decision, that suggests, albeit in a footnote, that in that situation, there are funds available in the sense that they're legally unrestricted.
Correct, and which are the funds that are that would be available here?
Which are they?
There aren't any funds that are available here in our view because.
If this were under Blackhawk.
Under Blackhawk, it would be it would it would essentially affect the entire lump sum appropriation because there's no legal requirement that the lump sum appropriation be be directed in any particular manner.
Now, there are some provisions in the.
That includes the 2 percent that you keep referring to.
That that would include in the that would include the 2 percent.
But there are provisions, I should note parenthetically, in the appropriations act that say specifically, for example, that not to exceed a certain amount is to be used for a particular function or at least a certain amount is to be used, for example, for contract health services.
So you'd have to take into account.
Then let me do this then.
those particular provisos.
You say if this were a classic, ordinary contract, the money would have been available legally speaking.
Nobody says practically speaking, and they could have brought their lawsuit.
Now, tell me specifically, if you can and this may take you the whole time.
You want to make whatever argument you want.
What is it that's special about this contract that brings it out of ordinary contracting principles?
Well, first and foremost, the text of the statute.
If you look at page 15a of the appendix to to the tribes' briefs, this isn't your standard, garden variety subject to availability clause.
You have to look at the particular context in which this statute.
Well, the language is the same.
It's not, Justice O'Connor, with respect.
It says, notwithstanding any other provision and I'm reading at the bottom of page 15a the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and and this is.
That phrase is the same, subject to the availability of appropriations.
That particular phrase resembles the one that Justice Breyer posited in his hypothetical.
But the term available and I think this is critical.
The term available is repeated in what's been referred to as the reduction clause, and I don't think one can understand what the term available means unless it considers the meaning of that term throughout that entire sentence.
But but the other the other side says you don't have to get to that because you could have paid the contract amounts here without reducing funds available for other tribes.
It's simply that it would have squeezed you in your budget, your your headquarters operating budget for IHS.
So they say, if I understand them, that the that the nonreduction clause doesn't save you here because you could have paid it without reducing things for other tribes.
I I think that argument is incorrect.
First of all, it's an incorrect interpretation of the terms of the reduction clause.
But second of all, the notion that funds for inherent Federal functions, the 2 percent that the agency reserved to perform its core agency functions, were available for contracting is contrary to to the terms of the ISDA itself.
And if you'll look at page 12a and I'm quoting from 450j-1(a)(1) what provision says is the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts include the amount that the Secretary, quote, would have otherwise provided.
And then later on down in the paragraph.
I don't see that.
I'm sorry.
Not less.
Shall not shall be not less than the amount that the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided.
And then further down in the paragraph in the last in the last clause, including support of administrative functions that are otherwise contractable.
And what otherwise contractable denotes is that there are certain functions that are not otherwise contractable, namely those core, inherent Federal functions that the agency itself is required to provide.
And so what 450j-1(a) implements is the background understanding that funds for core agency functions don't have to be turned over to the contracting tribes because the agency requires those funds in order to continue essentially to exist as a Federal agency.
But but I thought the submission of the petitioners' counsel was that some of these funds were used to monitor the contracts which are functions the tribes could have performed.
So is there a factual disagreement here?
I don't think so, Justice Kennedy.
I think it's more of a characterization disagreement.
There it's true that in a descriptive sense, one might refer to some of these funds as used for contract monitoring, but what 450j-1(a) says is that whatever you might call it, the funds that are used for core agency functions are outside the funds to be to be turned over.
It doesn't say that.
It doesn't say that.
What it says is otherwise contractable.
And they could certainly for a lay person like me in this, you'd think, well, we could have a provision that says $180,000 is hereby authorized to be spent only for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or Secretary of Interior.
Well, if it said that, then that's not otherwise contractable because there's a statutory limit.
But but.
So otherwise contractable sounds like a a statutory question.
But it it's not talking about money that's otherwise contractable.
It says, including supportive administrative functions that are otherwise contractable.
It's talking about a limitation upon the contractability of functions.
not the use of funds.
Well, it's talking about both because the the first part of subparagraph (1) is the amount of funds.
It's relating to the amount of funds that are required to be transferred, and what it stands for is that funds for supportive administrative functions that are not otherwise contractable, i.
, those core agency functions that the agency is required to perform itself, those funds aren't required to be turned over to contracting tribes.
And that just reflects the common sense principle that the agency has to continue to exist to perform some core functions.
But how do you how do you square that with the on page 14a reductions and, as Mr.
Miller read to us, shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract managing monitoring or administration by the Secretary, shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions, including but not limited to, and then a string of what I assume falls under the heading Federal functions.
Justice Ginsburg, the way we square that under the statute is that the leading the initial sentence in subsection (b) says the amount of funds required by subsection (a) of this section.
And our view of the statute is that funds for inherent Federal functions were never required to be transferred under subsection (a) to begin with.
And so what (b) deals with is the funds that are left over after the funds for inherent Federal functions are taken off the top.
So are these noninherent Federal functions shall not be reduced to pay for Federal functions?
So there's inherent Federal functions and noninherent?
Oh, absolutely there are.
The Federal functions is the broader set of it could essentially encompass everything the Federal Government does.
Inherent Federal functions refers to that core set of functions that the agency itself is required to perform.
And the distinction between inherent Federal functions and Federal functions, although it might seem trivial as a semantic matter, is reflected in fact in the definitions in title V of the ISDA where it specifically defines inherent Federal functions as a subset of Federal functions.
Does it ever define them as noncontractable?
I mean, I I your answer, I suppose, is well, what what do you think they're talking about, but does it ever expressly get to.
It it does.
the point of contractability?
It does, Justice Scalia Justice Souter.
Excuse me.
Thank you, but apologize to him.
And we describe the the relevant provision in our brief, if you'll bear with me for just one second, on page 31.
When Congress enacted the title IV self-governance provisions that relate to the BIA and this is at the beginning of the first partial paragraph that begins with of particular significance.
There's a provision there, 25 U.
And the provision reads that nothing in this section is intended or shall be construed to expand or alter existing statutory authorities so as to authorize the Secretary to enter into any agreement with respect to functions that are inherently Federal.
And I think what that signifies is that there are some functions that are not contractable and can't be turned over to the tribes.
That that all may be true, of course.
They're talking about don't contract out to the Indians something that should be done in Washington.
But what has that got to do with the issue?
We're talking, I thought, about about Government contracts.
People who enter into Government contracts need certainty.
They have to know whether that word, subject to appropriations, invalidates the contract or whether they have a valid contract.
And a set of principles have come up that are used to decide that.
And under that set of principles, money is available to pay for the contract if it's time, purpose, and amount.
That's the principle.
You don't think.
and I don't see anything contrary to that.
Justice Breyer, one background principle and it's reflected, by the way, in the terms of the contracts themselves.
One background principle is that funds for inherent Federal functions are not required to be transferred to tribes.
And the contracts.
Well, Mr.
Srinivasan, do you say that the contracts that were entered into by IHS and the tribes did somehow contract away Federal inherent Federal functions?
They specifically.
They didn't violate that section, did they?
The contracts that we're talking about.
They specifically did not transfer.
So we're not dealing with that.
We're dealing with contracts that didn't violate that section.
And you're just saying that some of the lump sum appropriation was diverted by the Government to pay for some kind of core Federal function, not that the contracts violated that provision.
The that's correct, Justice O'Connor.
What I'm responding to is the suggestion that funds that were allocated by the Secretary to pay for inherent Federal functions were required to be diverted to pay for the indirect costs.
You're not saying you're addressing not what was contracted out, but what funds are available.
That's where your argument is going.
It relates to the funds that are available.
And the tribes' position.
And you rely on the statement in (a) that the the only funds that are available are funds that include funds to to pay for supportive administrative functions that are otherwise contractable.
Not funds.
And not funds that are used to pay for administrative functions that are not contractable.
We think that funds for inherent Federal functions were taken off off the.
Can I.
You said that.
Can I ask you sort of a basic question that I'm having trouble following?
As I understand, you're saying 98 percent of the appropriation have been allocated to programs, projects, activities, and so forth that can't be reduced.
Now, is there anything in the statute that would have prevented the Secretary from allocating only 96 percent of the budget to those funds?
Well, there is, Justice Stevens, in the following sense.
It's not at all the case that the Secretary had unfettered discretion in composing the allocation scheme in any fiscal year.
But his budget that he actually worked out with the 98 percent was not mandated by the statute, as I understand.
In in part it was mandated by the statute.
In part but not in whole.
Perhaps not in whole.
Well, that's the point.
but at least in significant part.
And let me but I think this is significant, and if I can just walk the Court through the process by which the budget is developed and any appropriation ultimately is allocated.
The Secretary has always, both before the ISDA and after the ISDA, taken the current year's allocation across programs as a given, as a baseline from which the next year's allocation will be built.
And that's reflected in the terms of the statute on pages 14a to 15a of the appendix to the blue brief.
There's a provision, 450j-1(b)(2), that says that the amount that's transferred to contractors shall not be reduced by the Secretary in subsequent years except pursuant to certain limited criteria and one of which, the principal one of which, is the reduction in appropriations.
But we're not dealing with that in the relevant fiscal years.
There was always an increase.
And so the Secretary, pursuant to the statute, kept the funding for across programs at least at the level that it was at the previous fiscal year.
Now, in addition to that, the Secretary builds two two considerations on top.
The first is mandatory across-the-board increases for things such as salary COLA's and inflationary adjustments.
And that's a standard feature of budgeting, and it's reflected again in the terms of the statute.
And that I'd point the Court to page 9 of the Government's brief, the gray brief, where we cite a provision, 25 U.
Is the is the nub of what you're trying to tell me is that the 98 percent was, in fact, mandated by a statute?
It was I I think in principal part it was mandated by the by.
Principal part, but.
Well, let.
Does that mean that there was not enough?
At least as far.
They could have made it 97 percent.
insofar as what I've said with respect.
and had enough money.
to pay these contract obligations.
No, Justice Stevens.
See, the thing that troubles me is it seems to me your reading of the statute makes the contractual problem provision illusory because they can always allocate funds to all these other projects and say, well, we've already used up the money.
No, I don't think that they have discretion to do that.
And that's what I'm trying to explain.
At least with respect to the existing baseline and a mandatory across-the-board increases, it's mandated by the statute that the that the Secretary conduct his budgeting allocation process in the way that he's done.
With respect to the mandatory across-the-board increases, on page 9 of the Government's brief, 25 U.
1680a, a provision that relates specifically to the administration of the Self-Determination Act, it requires the Secretary to provide funds to contracting tribes for, quote, cost-of-living increases, closed quote, and, quote, other expenses relating to the provision of health services, closed quote, on the, quote, same basis as such funds are provided to programs and services operated directly.
In other words, with respect to mandatory across-the-board increases, the Secretary has to allocate those proportionately amongst contracting tribes and non-contracting tribes.
And that leaves the additional set of an increase from one year to the next year that deals with specific targeted items, and principally that would include, for example, staffing of new facilities that come on board during the course of a particular fiscal year.
And with respect to those specific targeted items, the critical point is that the contracting tribes often benefit from the addition of those and from the enforcement by the Secretary of those sorts of earmarks.
For example, in this particular case, the one of the facilities that's at issue is the Stillwell clinic in Oklahoma.
That was a new facility that came on board in the early 1990s and for which the for which the Cherokee Nation assumed administration of it through a self-determination agreement.
Now, the staffing for that facility was specifically earmarked in the Secretary's budget submissions and in in Congress' appropriation committee reports.
And it, of course, is in the Cherokee Nation's interest to ensure that those earmarks are honored.
Are you telling me that the committee reports are are binding law?
They're not binding law, Justice Stevens.
We fully recognize that.
But at the same time, I don't think that what Congress intended to do was to require the Secretary to completely ignore the committee reports.
But you got a conflict apparently between the committee reports and what seems to be pretty clear law, which says we're going to treat these contracts as contracts, not as intergovernmental agreements.
And in in that conflict, I don't see why contracting principles don't trump the committee reports.
It's not just the committee reports, Justice Souter.
It's the reduction clause.
The reduction clause is a part of the statute and no one has ever suggested the reduction clause doesn't inform the proper interpretation of the contract.
And and their their argument is that you can pay the contract amount without robbing other tribes of the amounts that the that the nonreduction clause refers to.
They are saying I think they're saying, look, you, the governmental bureaucracy, get squeezed.
And if so, the contract comes first and you have to live with the squeeze and go back to Congress and say, we're doing what you told us and we're getting squeezed out of existence.
I think that's what they're saying.
That is what they're saying, Justice Souter, but with respect to, I think it's incorrect.
The Government bureaucracy consists of two separate types of bureaucracy.
There's that core bureaucracy that is the inherent Federal functions.
And one of their arguments is that the Secretary was required to divest himself of the funds that were necessary to perform those functions.
No, he's not.
But if if where I'm really coming from, to be honest and I'd like you might as well reply to what I'm actually is why I'm asking these slightly hostile questions.
I I read here look, the question really is was this money like the bureaucracy money.
Is it legally speaking an appropriation available, not practically speaking but legally?
And here it seems to me, in looking through this somewhat quickly, that you say no, but the Board of Contract Appeals say yes.
And so I think in my mind, you know, one group of people who really know about this is the Board of Contract Appeals.
So if they're saying that money from a contract point a point of normal contract law is legally available, I promise you I'm predisposed to think they're right.
So I might as well expose that to you so you can tell me now why I'm wrong or they're wrong or whatever.
Because, Justice Breyer, I think the core of it is that even if you think that they're right, that these funds are legally available, that's not enough under the ISDA because the ISDA specifically reserves to the Secretary the discretion that he not be required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in order to make funds available to another tribe under this subchapter.
Well, there is is the kind the money that's available to one tribe can't be taken for the other.
But I thought the Board of Contract Appeals was saying taking that into account, there's still enough money left over.
Am I wrong about that?
I thought you should take money from one tribe to give it to another.
What did they think?
They thought the the board the Federal Circuit at least, which echoed the Board of Contract Appeals, thought.
Well, I'm thinking the Board of Contract Appeals and the Federal Circuit.
Well, I don't think the Board of of Contract Appeals really wrestled directly with where the funds were coming from.
They just thought that legal availability would be sufficient.
Now, what the Federal Circuit said was that funds for inherent Federal functions are available.
And we think that's wrong for the reasons I've said.
I don't think those funds ever came into the group of funds that were subject to be transferred to begin with.
But even if you thought that they did, I think it's clear that funds for inherent Federal functions are funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in the sense that one example of a core Federal function.
No, but if that's true, then everything then every penny in the in the IHS bureaucracy qualifies.
I mean, that swallows the that swallows the entire budget.
Well, let's Justice Souter, if I if I could, let's look at the particular sources.
No, no.
But I mean, just conceptually isn't that isn't that the the implication of what you're saying?
You you can't limit it to inherent Government functions.
Both the inherent and the noninherent Government functions would fall within this provision.
if you read it as broadly as you've just read it.
Well, I I guess the way I'd like to make the point is to say that the sources of funds that they point to, which include inherent Federal functions and the the noninherent Federal function bureaucracy that supports the administration of programs that serve tribes that are directly served by the Federal Government, those two are in fact programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe.
With respect to the administrative support.
On on that point on that point, in the Federal Circuit Judge Dyke expressed considerable displeasure with the Government because he said three times I said, tell me what existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced if these contract support costs are paid in full.
And he said, I asked them again and again and again, and they were unresponsive.
So since the Government declined to tell the court what programs existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced, mustn't we assume, as I think the Federal Circuit did, that the proof is unavailable and no existing program with other tribes would have been diminished?
I don't I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg.
I mean, one straightforward reason why you don't have to take that assumption is that it's not only the Federal Circuit case that's before the Court, it's also the Tenth Circuit case.
And there's there are declarations in the Tenth Circuit case that specifically assert that diverting funding for to pay for the contract support costs of these tribes would have required reducing funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe.
Now, what does that mean?
I mean, one thing is existing contracts, things that are already ongoing, and then another thing is, well, we think that there's a new program that could be good for some tribe.
So we're going to put that new program in and say that that steps in front of these contract support costs.
Are we talking just about existing programs that that the Government has made a commitment to, or are we saying the Government is at liberty to benefit tribes?
And so what if the contract support costs are, as a result, diminished?
We're still doing good for tribes.
We're talking about both existing programs and new programs, and with respect to new programs, there's it's every bit as likely that those new programs would benefit contracting tribes as noncontracting tribes.
And again, one of the new facilities.
It's strange to talk of reducing is is not required to reduce funding for a new program.
I mean, for a new program, there isn't any funding.
How can you reduce the funding for a new program?
That provision makes sense with regard to existing programs, but it doesn't make any sense with regard to proposed programs.
Well, I don't think that reduce necessarily takes the existing year's appropriation as the baseline.
We think that what it takes as the baseline is the current year's appropriation allocation which takes into account increases.
And one way to see that is 25 U.
1680a, which is the provision that I cited earlier that requires the Secretary to apportion mandatory across-the-board increases on a proportionate basis as between contracted programs and noncontracted programs.
And what that provision means is that the reduction takes into account those mandatory across-the-board increases from year to year.
So in some sense, I think reduce does mean this year's allocation of appropriations as opposed to last year's spending amount.
Srinivasan, you you alluded a moment ago in in answering Justice Ginsburg, I guess, to declarations on file on the Tenth Circuit case that that specifically said we would have to reduce funds available for other programs.
Did those declarations get specific in the way that her original question was was asking about?
Did it say did the declarations say we will have to reduce the X program for the Navajo Tribe and the Y program for the Apache Tribe and so on, or was it did the declarations simply say, as a general matter, we would have to reduce allocations for other tribes?
Well, they they make the point as a general matter, and they also give an example.
I think the one example that they give and maybe there are more is is a diabetes program.
But I think it's more the general principle.
Was that a new program or an existing program?
That's an the the particular example is an existing program.
But I think it's more.
It seems to me you can interpret those comments as saying we don't they did not leave enough room in the budget for the programs we now want to support and our prior contractual obligations.
You're you're speaking with particular respect to the new programs, Justice Stevens?
It seems to me that you can interpret what you're saying as the as the the Government adopting a budget in which there's not enough room for all the programs it wants to support in the current year and continuing to honor the obligations under the existing contracts.
Well, I don't think that even with respect to the current year there wouldn't be enough money to pay for the complete shortfall in contract support costs.
If you look at the figures, the shortfall in contract support costs, for example, in 1997 cumulatively was $82 million, and that's that is more than the amount of the appropriation increase from FY 1996 to FY 1997.
It's more than the amount that was reserved by the Government for inherent Federal functions.
And so even if you accepted that interpretation, it wouldn't be sufficient to fully fund the contract support costs.
Is there some way to avoid these problems now?
Has anything changed?
Justice O'Connor, Congress changed things by imposing a statutory cap, explicit statutory cap, on contract support cost funding beginning with 1998.
It had done so since 1994 for the BIA and it did so beginning in 1998 with respect to IHS.
Why was there that difference between the BIA that got the statutory caps earlier and not till, was it, 4 years later for the IHS?
I think the difference lies in the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall.
My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond.
And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the two.
But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the 1999 Appropriations Act.
And I think, if nothing else, section 314 at list at least expresses the view of a subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his discretion under the ISDA.
And under this Court's decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997.
So even if you thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA, I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation Act that its view was that Secretary had done so legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA.
I want to address really quickly, if I could, the notion that the funds for administrative support for programs that are administered directly by the Federal Government are available.
And that would have significant consequences because one of the policies underlying the act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that are currently entered into self-determination contracts, but it's to protect the amounts that are available to tribes that might some day choose to enter into self-determination contracts.
And if, under the tribes' view, the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of the increase in any particular year to contracting tribes or to to divert the entire amount of administrative support for for noncontracted programs to contracting tribes, the effect of that would be to freeze in place the amounts that were available for potentially contracting tribes in future years.
Thank you.
Miller, you have about 4 minutes left.
Justice Stevens, thank you.
First, I'd like to address the availability of appropriations clause briefly.
That is a term of art with a well-established meaning.
This Court in Morissette said that if unless there's a contrary direction from Congress that the term of art should not be given its well-established meaning, it controls.
And that is the meaning, purpose, time, and amount, that the appropriation is available for the purpose during the time and in the amounts necessary to fully.
I think they disagree with you about the purpose in respect to the core Government function.
Secondly, with regard to the core governmental functions, in Blackhawk, the contractor had a settlement with the Veterans Administration.
The Veterans Administration had to reprogram.
From where?
We don't know, but the Veterans Administration had to reprogram and wanted to get approval from the Congress for that reprogramming action.
Congress then stepped in but after the payment was due and forbade any reprogramming, and the Court then held when the payment was due, money was legally available and it doesn't matter where it comes from.
There is no protection for inherent Federal functions.
It may have come from some other hospital budget.
It may have come from some other activity of the Veterans Administration.
No doubt everything the VA does is important, but it doesn't mean it didn't have a legal obligation to pay the contract.
There is no rule that has an IFF exception to the governmental duty to pay, and if there was, it would upset Government contract law deeply as the amicus brief from the National Chamber explains.
Secondly, when funds are not available, we know what happens.
This Court's decision, Justice Brandeis' decision for the Court, in Sutton explains what happens when funds are not available.
There was a line item appropriation of $20,000 for a construction project.
We understand that the contractor was on notice.
Everything is square.
Here, the entire lump sum appropriation was available, and I'd like to give the Court a sense of where the money could have come from, not that the Government had to do it.
Just as in Blackhawk, if they chose not to reprogram, that's their right.
But then there's a remedy.
Where could the money have come from?
In 1994, there was slightly under $2 million in a shortfall, just to the Cherokee contractor.
No other contractor was apparently shorted.
There was up to $98 million in leftover appropriations that year.
There was 55 $88 million in an increase, up to $88 million in increase every year from $36 million to $88 million.
There was $25 million in inherent Federal functions.
They couldn't have shaved that by 10 percent to pay this contractor?
Not that they had to.
They could have taken some of it from there, some of it from the leftover, some of it from the increase, some of it from the offices at headquarters and area offices.
That was their decision.
But the contractor didn't take the risk that the Secretary would say, at the end of the day, I've decided to allocate 100 percent of my money this way, and by golly, there's nothing left for you.
No contractor takes that risk in dealing with the Government, and surely, a tribal contractor with a mandatory contract set forth in the statute doesn't take that risk either.
There is no limitation to the Secretary's theory in this case.
The Secretary's theory means that we come, the contractors come, after the allocation of the Secretary.
Well, the Secretary could, in a reduction year, decide to allocate the entire reduction to the contracts and enhance even his own Federal bureaucracy and programs serving other tribes and say, now I've made my decision and I've made my judgment.
I don't have enough money to pay you.
There's no limit here on contract support costs.
It could be the secretarial amount.
They could zero out these contracts and say it's practical availability.
And we've decided there isn't enough money to deal with all of the health care needs in the country, so we're going to deal with the ones we operate and you come last.
Now, that's not what the that's not what the statute permits.
That sort of interpretation would lead to an absurdity.
With regard to the Tenth Circuit decision, Justice, you asked a question about the declarations in the Tenth Circuit.
There was a declaration in the Tenth Circuit, but all it had was a conclusory statement, to have reprogrammed anything would have caused reductions in programs serving other tribes.
Now, that is not sufficient proof to withstand summary judgment, and it's certainly not sufficient proof to establish summary judgment.
So for all these reasons, we believe the Tenth Circuit decision should be reversed and the Federal Circuit decision affirmed.
Unless the Court has more questions.
Thank you, Mr.
Thank you, Justice Stevens.
We'll hear argument in Jackson against the Birmingham Board of Education.
Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Under the decision below, title IX stands alone as the only major civil rights statute that would permit retaliation against those who complain that the law is being violated.
There are at least a half a dozen anti-discrimination laws that do not contain a separate retaliation provision, and every one of them has been found to prohibit retaliation as one kind of discrimination.
There's a reason for that.
Anti-discrimination laws simply can't be effective if threats of retaliation are allowed to chill those who would seek to bring their institutions into compliance.
Of course, the question is whether that that may be true, but there would be an administrative remedy.
The question here is a private cause of action for damages.
That is true, Justice Kennedy.
Even even assuming the the validity of your premise, you still have another step.
I understand that other step, and I think that was largely resolved in Cannon v.
the City of Chicago, a decision which this Court upheld a right of action to enforce title IX, even though there was also administrative remedies available and which was validated by Congress, as this Court every member of this Court recognized in in Sandoval.
I thought I thought that Cannon we've we've allowed Cannon to stay on the books, but I thought we have sworn off the kind of creation of of implied remedies that Cannon exemplifies.
In this case, there is no doubt that the two established principles together that are settled support this cause of action.
The first is that there is a cause of action to enforce title IX.
That's Cannon through Congress, through Sandoval, through your opinion in Sandoval acknowledges that Cannon is solid law and, the second point, that the statute itself is violated.
Title IX is violated by retaliatory action against Coach Jackson.
He's and and this is an important part of title IX because, particularly here, people like Coach Jackson need to come forward because students are often minors.
They're not in the best position to know the budgets.
It is people like Coach Jackson who make it work, and indeed, I think what is recognized about the about the cause of action for retaliation is that it is very important to enable people to bring their institutions into compliance without resorting to litigation.
It's very it's very useful, I'm sure, but it it could be very disruptive also, I am sure.
If I were if I were a coach, one of the first things especially a coach of a women's team in high school, one of the first things I would do would be to complain about not not getting enough facilities.
This would make it a lot more difficult to fire me whether whether I'm a lousy coach or not.
You you would have to think twice before you fire me because I would have a retaliation claim.
Justice Scalia, the burden, of course, is on the plaintiff to demonstrate causation.
And you should take great comfort from the fact, the Court can take great comfort from the fact that retaliation has been established as a violation of all of the major civil rights statutes, going back to 30 years to title VI.
Some of them specifically provide for retaliation, don't they?
That is correct.
Why do they do that if, as you assert, the mere word discrimination embraces it?
Well, Congress has taken a different approach.
In some cases, there would be a textual problem.
Title VII, for example, speaks of discrimination based on such individual's race or national origin.
Title and and therefore, it might need a specific retaliation provision.
Title IX speaks upon about discrimination on the basis of sex.
And here I think to to allay your concern about the coach, we have had title IX's retaliation provision has been the established law.
It was the law at the time Congress it was understood, at the time Congress enacted title IX, that the identical wording of title VI had been construed by the administrative agency to include a cause of action for retaliation.
Congress enacted title IX against the background of the Sullivan decision, which had recognized that discrimination can include retaliation.
So that it comes as no surprise that every court of appeals that has addressed this issue has found that there's retaliation under title IX.
In over 30 years, there at most we can find 140 reported cases in the Federal system where there is a claim for retaliation under title IX, and under title IX and all of the other discrimination provisions, courts have found it perfectly satisfactory to work out the causation requirements and in in dealing with retaliation cases.
Now, here, what the respondent did is they discharged the coach who was seeking equal treatment for girls.
When it singled Coach Jackson out for adverse treatment, it was discriminating, and when it did so, because he was seeking equal treatment for girls, it was discriminating on the basis of sex.
Do you think that it it is a reasonable description of what happened he was fired for complaining about his girls' team not getting enough facilities that he was, on the basis of sex, excluded from participation in, denied benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under an education program?
Do you think that that remotely describes what happened to this coach?
First of all, the the court of appeals correctly says in the petition appendix at 3a, the court of appeals says we assume for the purposes of this appeal that the board retaliated against Jackson for complaining about perceived title IX violations.
But for the discrimination on the basis of sex, he would not have complained, and he not had he not made a complaint about sex discrimination, he wouldn't have lost his position.
He is denied the benefit of coaching in the program.
He's denied the ability to participate in this federally funded program as a coach, and he is discriminated against by being singled out for retaliation.
And this is not a case in which that has concern I mean, Justice Kennedy raised the question about this being a funding case, and I understand the special sensitivity that the Court has about rules that are based upon spending requirements where you want to be sure that States understand what they're agreeing to when they accept the Federal funds.
This is not a case in which it could not have been anticipated when those funds were accepted.
At that time, at the time these funds were accepted, which would have been about 1999 or 2000, title IX's ban on sex discrimination was itself, of course, universally known.
Retaliation was understood to be part and parcel of that.
We had had 30 years where both the Department of Education and.
But but that's again the question of the substantive scope of the provision, and that's different from whether there was a congressional intent to create a private cause of action for this sort of violation.
And was it Virginia Bankshares and so forth tells us that this is not the heyday of prior cause of actions anymore.
You have to show that there's a congressional intent in the Spending Clause to create a private cause of action for damages.
I think the Court.
And that's that's quite separate from.
I I.
from this from the question of substantive liability.
I understand that.
Here, first of all, when Congress acted, unlike the earlier time when it passed title VI, when Congress passed title IX, it was a background in the law from Sullivan v.
Little Hunting Park that that retaliation was considered a part of discrimination.
The title VI regulations were themselves well known based on identical language, virtually verbatim language.
It provided for retaliation.
And moreover, this Court as recently as the Davis case, Franklin and Davis, and in the North Haven case has found that employment discrimination, sexual harassment by teachers and peer-on-peer sexual harassment all come within title IX and have, therefore, agreed that Cannon v.
the City of v.
the University of Chicago creates that cause of action.
Now, this case is actually a lot easier than Davis, even taking into account the concerns that that you and other Justices expressed there, because this is not a case where liability is being imposed, you know, for the acts of third parties like students over whom you may have limited control.
This is deliberately undertaken actions by the responsible officials acting intentionally.
It's not a novel concept the way one could argue that peer-on-peer sexual harassment was as a part of discrimination.
But it's been accepted for more than 30 years by the responsible Federal agency.
Yes, but it's separate enough from discrimination that in other statutes, although Congress does create a cause of action for discrimination, it goes out of its way to create a separate cause of action for retaliation.
It's sufficiently separate, and if it is that sufficiently separate, it doesn't seem to me that you could clearly say that that when the State signed on to receiving Federal funds under title IX, they should have known that this door to litigation was being opened to them.
Yes, litigation for for discrimination against against female athletes, but not not discrimination suits alleging retaliation.
That's a whole, new area.
Justice Scalia, with with all due respect, I don't think there's any way, when the district accepted these funds, that they could have reasonably relied on the assumption that they would be free to retaliate against people who tried to comply.
Well, but there was there was let's go back to this for just a moment an administrative remedy available for retaliation expressly under the regs?
That is correct.
And did this petitioner seek an administrative remedy at all?
He did not seek an administrative remedy.
He went through the school system itself at every level.
He went through five different levels, following the chain of command.
What would the administrative remedy have allowed here.
had it been sought?
Here, as in Franklin, as in Davis, as in Cannon v.
the University of Chicago, as in every one of this Court's title IX cases, indeed, as in all of its title VI cases involving Federal funds with race, you can call this to attention to the office of civil rights of the relevant agency and they can begin an inquiry.
Ultimately they have the authority of the draconian sanction of cutting off the funds to the.
Do they have any other sanction?
Because the notion of an administrative remedy ordinarily would be a remedy for the individual who's complaining.
But as I understand it, this administrative process, this detailed administrative process, leads only to one sanction, the one you have described as draconian.
That is correct.
So that's it.
It would not have permitted a restoration of the job to the.
That is correct.
That is not part of the the administrative process is only about institutional funding, which is why the Court has consistently upheld the right to bring these actions for what are violations of the statute itself.
Well, if we don't accept let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that that we're having trouble accepting the the analysis that it is a violation of the statute in the statute's own terms.
You then made the argument that, in fact, you should recognize retaliation as a claim because in the context of of school students and so on, if you don't allow retaliation, the teachers are not going to blow the whistle, and if the teachers blow the whistle, the statute is going to be a dead letter.
That is.
So so the the argument is you you should recognize this as a necessity.
That, it seems to me, still goes back to Justice O'Connor's question.
Why do we have to recognize a private cause of action as opposed to the government allowing an administrative remedy?
And I thought you were leading up to saying the administrative remedy simply isn't effective because it's so draconian that, in fact, they don't impose it, or for some other reason.
So my question is, is there an argument to say that the administrative remedy simply is not good enough to preclude to to deter retaliation and that's why you've got to have a private cause of action?
That that is absolutely right.
What's what are the facts?
What's the empirical evidence for that?
Do you know if administrative sanctions have been imposed under title IX against schools?
Well, I'm sure there have been some instances in which there have been administrative sanctions under title IX.
And I don't I do not have figures on those, Justice O'Connor.
But let me.
Have funds.
let me suggest.
have funds Mr.
Dellinger, have funds ever been withdrawn from any school because of a violation of.
Not to my knowledge.
title IX?
But I think.
That could be because.
I actually have.
the sanction is so draconian that nobody in his right mind is not going to rehire the coach.
Of course, they're going to rehire.
I I find it hard to believe why a draconian sanction is ineffective.
Well, if it's never I I.
It seems to me it's it's overwhelmingly effective.
You tell the school you either rehire the coach or we're cutting off your money.
Is it hard to decide what they're going to do?
I do have an answer, first, for Justice Ginsburg's question from Ms.
The sanction has never been imposed under title IX of cutting off funds.
And it.
And I can't imagine anyone who would want such a sanction.
Which doesn't help.
That is certainly not what.
the girls on the team.
Coach Coach Jackson would have sought, and and because that process is not one that's responsive to the individual case if you're down in Birmingham, Alabama, the idea that there is some office that has control over Federal funds that's never imposed a sanction, the fact of the matter is and it's the reason.
Well, you're saying the coach cares more about it than the Government does?
That may well be the case, absolutely.
And Coach Jackson.
Well, if if the Government is charged with with just spending the funds and doesn't think that this is worth its time, why should there be a private cause of action.
when when a private cause of action is harder for us to imply than it than it is to an administrative remedy?
Because in this case people like Coach Jackson it's hard enough for Coach Jackson to come forward.
If he's not able to if he's not protected and able to come forward, if retaliation is possible, then you can't expect the the teenagers themselves to carry this burden.
And in fact, it's the reason this Court recognizes a private cause of action in Franklin and in Davis and in Cannon itself, that you're not going to protect the whistle blower and they're not going to be able to come forward.
And it's not just whistle blowers, Justice Kennedy.
It's people that want to make their institutions comply and when those efforts at compliance result in penalties against them.
It has not led to an excessive amount of litigation, but it has been very effective in giving people comfort to know that they can't be retaliated against.
And and I I understand the going to the necessity, but I do think I'm very comfortable with the statute because it is a form of discrimination on the basis of sex.
It is part and parcel.
The history of discrimination, on which title VI drew, was that firing people from their jobs is what you did when they complained about discrimination, when they tried to vote, when they tried to enroll their students in schools, and it is part and parcel of that discrimination.
And it is discrimination against Coach Jackson for his actions on behalf of sex.
Thank you.
I'll reserve the balance of my time.
Gornstein, do you have any light to shed on the extent to which administrative sanctions have ever been imposed against schools and and the feasibility of going that route?
Administrative sanction has never been imposed under title IX.
They have been under title VI?
There has been one case in which an administrative sanction was imposed under title VI, Justice Kennedy.
It the agency does have some flexibility to attempt to get voluntary resolutions that are short of the sanction, the final sanction, but.
Do you take the position that what occurred here can amount to a direct violation of the statute as discrimination?
We do, Justice Justice O'Connor.
I'm sorry.
Retaliation against a person because that person has complained about sex discrimination under title IX is itself discrimination within the meaning of title IX.
And that conclusion flows from four considerations, beginning with the Court's decision critically in Sullivan because in that case, the Court held that a person subjected to retaliation because he complained about racial discrimination against his lessee could sue under section 1982's prohibition, which only prohibits racial discrimination.
Against the backdrop of that decision in Sullivan, Congress would have understood its prohibition against sex discrimination to afford comparable protection against retaliation.
So a person who is subjected.
Why would Congress then in some statutes expressly cover retaliation and in others not?
I mean, that's a little odd, isn't it?
It is, Justice O'Connor, but the explanation for that for in title VII, for example, is that the core prohibitions in title VII refer to discrimination based on such individual's race, sex, or national origin, and that such individual's language rules out the kind of retaliation claim we are talking about here.
It rules out this one, but it doesn't rule out the main look it, this is a weird kind of retaliation claim.
Usually the retaliation claim is the person who has been discriminated against complains about the discrimination, and for that complaint, the person who was discriminated against is demoted or not promoted, or whatever.
That's that's the classic retaliation claim.
And that classic claim is surely covered by on the basis of that person's sex.
If it's based on the fact that the that the person is complaining about sex discrimination and not on the sex of the complainer, it's exactly the same theory of discrimination that we have here, Justice Scalia.
And that theory of discrimination was recognized in the Sullivan decision.
Discrimination occurs when there is retaliation against a person because he's complaining about racial discrimination.
What was the date of the Sullivan case?
It was 3 years before Congress enacted section I think it was '68 '69.
I'm sorry.
It was '69, Justice Scalia.
And and you think that we take the same approach to implied causes of action today that we took in 1969?
You do not, Justice Scalia, when you are starting afresh, but.
And we certainly did not with a Spending Clause case.
That's true, Justice Kennedy.
But to answer Justice Scalia's question, first, you operate in the legal context in which Congress was operating at the time, and Congress would have understood and this Court has twice relied on the Sullivan decision in interpreting title IX, once in deciding that there was a private right of action and once in deciding that the private right of action included a claim for damages.
I don't know what case it is, but one of our cases, the argument was precisely made that the statute before us had been enacted by Congress before we had set our face against implied causes of action, and therefore, we should interpret that statute the way we used to in 1969, and we rejected that argument.
We said that our new rule, as to when you find implied causes of action, will be applied to all statutes, whether they were enacted by a Congress that that thought we would go skipping along forever as we did in 1969 or or not.
And and that's what you're asking us to do here.
Just because Congress in in the at the time this statute was enacted believed in the existence of a Supreme Court that would readily find implied causes of action, we we have to do that for all these old statutes.
Let let me talk about the cases that I think the principle that you're talking about emerges from.
One is the Central Bank case, and what you were asked to do there was to add the words, aiders and abetters, to the statute.
We're not asking you to add words to this statute.
We're asking you to interpret the words that are there.
But what about Virginia.
in light of the relevant context.
What about Virginia Bankshares?
I'm I'm not sure about Virginia Bankshares, but I don't think it it states a principle.
The other case that I was thinking about, Justice Kennedy, is the is the Sandoval case.
And again, there somebody was asking you to afford a private right of action for something that the statute did not itself prohibit.
And what we are saying here is, interpret this statute in light of the legal context that Congress had it, which is.
Well, it it's arguable except that Mr.
Jackson was not discriminated against because of his gender.
That's correct.
But this statute does not require discrimination because of such individual's sex.
It require.
exactly like title VII, but.
It's it's written exactly not like title VII, Justice O'Connor, and it's written far more like section 1982, which was at issue at Sullivan, which doesn't have a such individual's limitation.
And in and section 1982 was interpreted to mean discrimination on the basis of race in depriving people of interests of property violates that statute and affords a private right of action to the victim of retaliation.
And so too here.
And a person who is victimized by retaliation because that person has been subjected before because he complained about sex discrimination is a victim of discrimination within the meaning of this statute.
And that's where you hang.
You you really think Congress, when it enacted title IX, paid close attention and said instead of saying no person in the United States shall on the basis of that person's sex be excluded from participation, you think somebody had had suggested that language, and they said, oh, no, no, no, that would make it too narrow.
We have to take out that person's.
I I don't it doesn't strike me as a as an obvious import of not including the word that person's sex.
It's a very natural way to write it: no person in the United States shall on the basis of sex.
But this is it opens it up to this interpretation, and then you have to look at all the relevant considerations.
Inserting the words, such individual's, would foreclose that kind of retaliation claim, and it's not here.
And so it's then you have to look at all the other relevant considerations, including Sullivan, including the fact that this is of vital importance to promoting the purposes of the act, including the fact that the agencies responsible for enforcing this provision have both interpreted the key agencies have interpreted it to encompass protection against retaliation, and including the fact that there's absolutely no legitimate interest that a a recipient has in retaliating against somebody simply because he's filed a title IX sex discrimination complaint.
Gornstein, what implication would there be, if we took the view of the circuit here, for Federal employment?
Title VII does have a discrete retaliation provision, but it doesn't with respect to Federal employees, if I understand.
That's correct.
In it we we have taken the position that there is, based on a textual argument within the Federal sector provision, a basis for finding a retaliation prohibition over and above the use of discrimination.
We have not taken that position with respect to the to some other statutes.
So we do think this is a statute-by-statute analysis and that you just can't adopt an automatic principle that because there's an anti-discrimination provision, it automatically always picks up retaliation protection.
You have to look at it on a statute-by-statute basis.
And here, though, all the relevant considerations, including Sullivan, including the need for this kind of protection to further the purposes of the statute, including the agencies' interpretation of this statute which, by the way, does provide fair notice that this was prohibited, included in I think I wanted to get back to Justice Kennedy's question about the Spending Clause.
What the Spending Clause does not require is that it specifically refer to retaliation any more than it required that it specifically refer to peer-on-peer harassment.
What it does require, though, is fair notice, and that fair notice is supplied by the Sullivan decision, this Court's cases saying that Sullivan is an important backdrop principle against which title IX was enacted, and finally the regulations themselves, which specifically forbid retaliation.
Are punitive damages available under title IX?
I'm sorry.
Punitive damages would not be available against a municipality or against a but it could be available against some other private recipients.
Thank you, Mr.
Justice Stevens, may it please the Court: Justice O'Connor, I would like to respond to the question that you raised immediately.
I can't think of any school board lawyer who is called by his superintendent and told that I had a letter from OCR and they want to know why you aren't doing this and that who would not be in that superintendent's office that moment because when OCR comes in, they canvas everything.
I mean, and as a part of negotiating and their investigative teams, they're lay people.
They're not lawyers.
They come in demanding, and what they prepare for compliance, I can't even begin to articulate how overreaching it is.
And so I say I wanted you to.
How often has OCR come to the school district in question under title IX?
There are many statutes that.
And I would want to suggest.
OCR administers.
In 1996, we had a conclusion of an OCR title IX investigation because it dealt with boys' football as it related to related sports offered for girls.
So we we know about OCR, and they're in Atlanta.
They are about 167 miles away and when and when they come, they come, Your Honors.
If I may, I'd like to get right now to what I had raised as the issue here, and that's whether or not an implied private right of action under title IX for retaliation for petitioner who himself says that he's not a victim of discrimination, but merely an advocate.
He's an advocate of gender equity, and we say no.
How does he differ how does he differ from the renter in Sullivan who was complaining about the refusal to sell or lease property to African Americans?
He wanted to lease his property, and as a result, he was thrown out of the club.
And this Court said he could maintain that suit.
Justice Ginsburg, I offer this one observation.
Under 1982, there is not a corollary administrative remedy.
So in the Sullivan situation, the only advocate available at that time was the owner of the home.
And but I would comment that as he continued in his litigation, he continued to advocate.
Under title IX, as we have discussed, for the advocate is the phone call, the toll-free call to OCR and express your concerns and your issues about what's happening.
And we find significance in that because the ultimate benefit is for the designated class, which would be the basketball team.
In a private lawsuit filed by Mr.
Jackson, the damage award goes directly to him.
If he's successful in getting injunctive relief, it goes only to him.
In other words, school board, you can't retaliate or you're enjoined from retaliating against him in the future, but nothing from that Federal court would go to benefit the girls' basketball team.
Well, what what do you make of the the point that Mr.
Dellinger stressed and others have stressed that, in fact, there is no administrative remedy in the real world?
It's it's there there have never there has never been an instance in which funds have been withheld.
Well, again, Justice Souter, no, the funds have not been terminated.
But I can only share with you my experiences with dealing with these people.
May I ask you with respect to that, is OCR so different from other agencies that have to pick and choose because they simply don't have the resources to enforce?
Now, how often does OCR, in fact, go in and investigate?
How many times do they say, well, that's low priority for us, girls' soccer or girls' basketball, and we have bigger fish to fry?
Justice Ginsburg, the only thing that I can say is that on my watch, the number one priority is to keep OCR out.
So so therefore.
But that wasn't my question.
My question is of the universe of complaints that are made under title IX, how many does OCR actually follow up, or isn't it strapped for resources so that it can't, however much it may want to, come in the way you described?
Well, Your Honor, that was something that was recognized in Cannon.
I I think that was cited in several of the footnotes.
And that was the very reason for recognizing a private right of action because the the requirement, the anti-discrimination requirement, would be a dead letter if you didn't have people who could enforce it.
But but again, stay mindful.
Geraldine Cannon, though, she said, I did not get admission to the the med school because of my sex, and she is clearly within the proviso of no discrimination on the basis of sex.
Yes, but the the argument that's being raised is whether we're talking about the person who is listed in the statute as the primary beneficiary of the anti-discrimination statute or whether we're talking about the teacher who blows the whistle and so on the the argument is unless you allow this teacher or this whistle blower to to bring the private action, your statute is a dead letter, that the that if if once you recognize a private action, you've either got to recognize this kind of private action or you can forget the whole thing.
That's the argument, and and so simply to say, well, they're not within the the primary ambit of benefit of the statute is is not to the point of the argument.
Justice Souter, let me offer this in two ways.
One, it's not realistic.
In in other words, when when you have a scenario about the private cause of action, teachers aren't I mean, these parents and and the and especially in Birmingham, we have an athletic director at the school.
We have a director of athletics for the whole school system.
And so that that's not realistic, I mean, because at the end of the day, the administration is very conscientious about all of its programs.
Well, that's to say trust me is is not an answer.
Cannon is one thing, a woman in her 30's.
A sixth-grader who is told she can't play on a team because there's none for girls is hardly similarly situated and the law won't be enforced as to her unless you have someone who is best positioned to know what is going on, who is the coach.
But, Justice Ginsburg, we get back to the point who really benefits because and especially in this scenario, if the advocate sues and receives the monetary damages, that goes to the advocate.
The the point is if you say to the school, you cannot retaliate against someone because a complaint has been made, that's a powerful incentive for the school not to retaliate against someone and to do something about the discrimination.
Well, but again, though, Justice Ginsburg, the other side of that would be when under the spending legislation, the school board had a right to know what the terms and conditions of the financial assistance would be, and I respectfully submit to you that there was nowhere on the landscape that.
Why wasn't it in the regulations of the agency spelled out rather clearly the the agency that says, Congress has told us to implement this statute, here are our regulations and our regulations are you don't retaliate?
But that's a part of the complaint and investigatory process.
Now, Justice Ginsburg.
The regulations didn't say anything about a private cause of action, did it?
No, it did not.
And the statute didn't say anything about a private cause of action.
It's not on the face.
But the regulation did tell the school not to retaliate in effect.
Tell me, does the record disclose what happened to the petitioner, Jackson?
What what has been the result of all this?
Does the record tell us that?
No, it does not, Justice O'Connor.
And and again, it's on a motion to dismiss, and obviously, once it was.
Does it tell us that he was removed as coach?
Does the record tell us that?
It it does say that he was relieved.
Can I ask you a legal question, nothing to do with, you know, practicalities?
But suppose you go back to the very old, bad days of the 1950's in the South, the '60's.
They pass some civil rights legislation.
A lot of legislation was passed in the '60's.
Now, under that civil rights legislation, imagine an individual had been kept out of a restaurant or he'd been treated physically badly, not because of his race.
He was white, but he was associating with people who were black.
And they both go into the restaurant and they both are refused service.
Maybe they're beaten up.
I mean, both of them.
Now, can the white individual bring a lawsuit under the the civil rights statute?
I've always thought the answer to that question is, of course, he can.
Would you do you think it's the contrary answer?
Justice Breyer, in that context.
I I would say yes.
Yes, of course.
But again.
So therefore.
Is this a civil rights statute that provides for a private cause of action?
I I want to know what the hypothetical is.
I'd I'd like to I'm thinking of various civil rights statutes which make it unlawful to describe to to discriminate.
And now, I agree with you on that answer.
The white person could bring a lawsuit on the basis of someone else's race because he's being discriminated against not because of his own race, but because he's being he's associated with people who are being discriminated against.
I agree with your answer.
And so my question is if that's so and if we have a long history here of the words, on the basis of sex, including retaliation not on the basis of my sex, but retaliation on the basis of someone else's sex that's what I've complained of why isn't this the same thing And to get out my whole question there are two parts why isn't this the same thing?
And the second part is, because I think it is the same thing the second part is once it is included in 1981 in is it 1681(a)?
Once we include this in 1681(a), that's the end of this case because Sandoval then supports the other side.
It doesn't support you.
All right.
That's my question.
Justice Breyer, don't we have to consider at some point in time what the congressional intent was?
Well, yes.
And again and I submit to you.
So you you go ahead.
I'm doing it purely as a matter of logic.
I'm saying the old civil rights cases make clear it doesn't have to be on the basis of your own race.
History makes clear that retaliation on the basis of someone else's race does fit within or gender does fit within 1681, and then that's the end of the case.
So I would like your response to that logic.
And I would want to submit to you interveningly you have had the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
So everybody now has access to Congress.
The whole spectrum of American society is in Congress.
So if Congress is being well represented, when it passes the law in 1972, as it did here, it had a different perspective on it.
Going back to 1969, some things were foreclosed to some of the citizens of the United States.
So, obviously, the scenario of someone advocating, like in Sullivan, would make sense.
But I submit to you respectfully, that's not the case now.
Over there in Congress is where this debate needs to be, and on the face of this statute, it's not there.
Retaliation is not there.
If I may, though, Justice Breyer, let me also add as a practical consideration.
Of course, you say it's not there, but the agencies interpreting the statute thought it was there.
Isn't that correct?
But but that's an an investigatory the administrative enforcement scenario.
But it's the.
No, but their reading of the statute was that the word discrimination included a retaliation claim.
That's the kind of regulations they drafted on the basis of their understanding of what Congress intended by using the word the words in this statute.
But don't we go Justice Stevens, don't we go back to Sandoval?
Can you in a regulation do more than what the statute requires?
You cannot use the regulation that goes beyond the meaning of the statute.
That's what that holds.
But a regulation interpreting what the statute itself provides is in a different ball park.
And that's what I understand these regulations to have done, to say what the agencies thought the statute itself meant.
But but again, that's retaliation after someone has filed a complaint with the appropriate office.
Well I mean, Sandoval is very clear.
It's a very clear opinion in my view.
Very clear.
And the key language I thought is, the language statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer the private right.
So they're looking at disparate impact and disparate impact, according to the majority I was in the dissent did not intend to protect the person discriminated against, but was a way of regulating people so they wouldn't intentionally discriminate.
I can understand that.
But I apply the same I didn't agree with it, but I can understand it.
The the I apply the same reasoning here.
The reasoning here is that this retaliation thing is not trying to protect university behavior one whit more than the whole underlying thing is trying to protect university behavior.
This is about victims.
Retaliation and being fired is about victims.
And so given Sandoval, then we have the history, we have the language, and we have that sentence from Sandoval.
And all that suggests it goes into 1681(a), in which case Sandoval says, a private right of action, given Cannon, would be inferred.
Now, what's what's that's how I'm tracing out the logic of the thing.
So I want to see what you say.
Well, Justice Breyer, on the face of the statute, I just can't get there.
I apologize for that, respectfully, but but I can't.
And Justice O'Connor, as a follow-up, interestingly enough, in a case on all fours in 1995, Holt v.
Lewis, the United States District Dourt for the Northern District of Birmingham for the Northern District of Alabama made very clear that an implied private right of action was not cognizable under title IX, and that the regulation was not a basis to follow it.
And and I submit to you on that basis, that in Birmingham, at very least, because the case was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit and this Court denied cert in 1997, so anyone who would go.
We we can't you don't base your argument on giving some legal effect to denial of certiorari.
No, no, I don't, Justice O'Connor.
Thank you.
But but to say I was trying to emphasize was the notice and the mind set of the board when it accepted these Federal funds.
It had no way of anticipating that retaliation.
It had never anticipated a private right of action, even though it read the Cannon opinion, which was written some 20 years ago?
Maybe more than that.
I don't remember.
Justice Cannon, your opinion there is going to be around for a long time.
The scholars are going to have to debate it for years.
There were some later cases that cast a good deal of doubt on whether we would apply Cannon anymore.
But Congress itself has adopted the rule set forth in Cannon.
But but if I may, but then Justice Rehnquist cautioned very clearly that the Court in his concurring opinion, that the Court in the future should be extremely reluctant to imply a cause of action absent such specificity on the part of the legislative branch.
And that just speaks volumes to me.
It said in this statute we do, having in mind that title VI would be interpreted in the identical way.
Yes, ma'am.
title VII VI proscribing race discrimination in all Federal programs.
So it said these statutes aimed at race discrimination, sex discrimination do have a a private right of action, and that was the holding of this Court.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, but but again, it goes goes back to but would that include retaliation?
And and.
Well, it seems to me that if you're talking about the sixth grade soccer team, realistically the only one who is going to know anything enough and be brave enough to complain will be the teacher.
And if you cut the teacher out, then forget it.
You have nice words on paper and they'll never be enforced.
But, Justice Ginsburg, that teacher could easily, if they don't get a positive response from the administration, they can call OCR.
And OCR says, as it usually does, we're too busy.
They no.
Congress didn't give us enough money to do the job.
Do we know that?
I mean, do we have any idea how effective the enforcement of OCR is?
Just because they haven't cut off funds.
I I.
they may well not have cut off funds because anybody who gets a directive from them will hop to it.
Justice Scalia, that's exactly it.
I mean, I have firsthand knowledge that when they call, we're supposed to jump.
It's no doubt about it.
And do they call more than infrequently?
All the time.
And and the other side of that coin.
This is your personal testimony.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, it is.
And and Justice.
There is there is much testimony on the other side that says we call and call and they don't come.
Well, I've been in educational law now almost 27 years, representing both teachers and school boards.
So I have firsthand knowledge.
I mean and I've experienced it both at the secondary level and higher ed.
I mean, when they come in, they come in.
How many title IX complaints in your in your experience?
You mentioned one.
Is there any other?
In how many years?
In 26.
Two in 20-something years.
Yes, ma'am.
But they're all memorable.
They're all thank you.
Thank you, Mr.
Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address, if I may, several concerns that have been raised during the the preceding arguments.
One is to clarify some things about the scope of the administrative remedy.
The other side, with respect, wants you to think that without the implied right of action for damages and fees, whistle blowers are left out in the cold.
That is not true.
The administrative remedy it's not just about funding termination.
34 C.
3 says that the OCR may use any remedy that it deems necessary.
The OCR, as we say in our brief, has itself touted its flexible approach to enforcement which includes, among other things, as this Court noted in Gebser, citing back to its earlier pardon me decision in North Haven, individualized relief in appropriate circumstances.
So the point, as Senator Bayh himself noted on the floor of the Senate, is that it is the threat of of funding termination.
So while the OCR is wielding the club of funding termination, they can extract or leverage individualized relief in appropriate cases.
Do we do we have any any empirical evidence as to as to what they have thus leveraged?
None that I am aware of, Your Your Honor, but.
The the other side says, look, dead letter.
What do we know about such life as there may be in the letter?
Well well, I will, I assume, perhaps foolishly, defer to the Solicitor General's office to tell you what what the DOJ has and hasn't done.
What I can tell you is that that the DOJ manual that the other side cites throughout its briefs expressly encourages agencies, when enforcing these these things, to leverage even damage awards on behalf of individual claimants.
So I can tell you that, as a matter of policy, this is far from a dead letter.
You you don't concede the point that it is the role of this Court to determine whether agencies are inefficient or not.
Of course not.
and if they are inefficient to to raise up private attorneys general to to fill the void?
Of course not, Justice Scalia, and and the Court knows very well from my brief that our position is that when you're talking about implied rights of action, this Court has made clear, in the cases leading up to Sandoval, culminating in Sandoval, that these sorts of policy considerations really are not relevant.
All right.
If they're not relevant, do you think that the regulation which provides do you think it's unlawful?
We do not contest the validity of the regulation.
If you don't contest the validity of it and you think it's lawful, do you think it's doing something other than interpreting 1681(a)?
Absolutely, Your Honor.
What what is it doing?
It section 100.
7(e), the regulation upon which Jackson chiefly relies, we readily concede is a valid, effectuating 902 regulation, but all all it does by its text and its structure makes clear all it does is to govern the internal processes of official OCR investigations.
It does not go further than that.
This Court in Sandoval was very clear that it was that it was only authoritative interpretations of a statute's terms that can be enforced pursuant to that statute's implied right of action.
Another point I want to make about the administrative remedy.
Justice Ginsburg asked whether funds had ever been withdrawn, and even there, again, if the answer is no, the point is not whether funds have been withdrawn, but that as Senator Bayh himself noted, that the threat of funds is where the heavy lifting is done in administrative enforcement.
Another point about administrative enforcement is whether or not there are sufficient resources.
That, obviously, was a valid concern in Cannon, given presumably the inordinate number of complaints about core, traditional discrimination.
But as the other side has made clear in its briefing in this case, at page 26 of the petitioner's brief and then there's a brief filed on behalf of the Southern Poverty Law Center that spins this out in some detail there just aren't many of these retaliation claims out there, either in the either either in the judicial system or at OCR.
Why is that, do you think?
Well, my I'm sorry.
Is it because no remedy is available, or is it because there are just very few instances giving rise to such?
Well, I think in all likelihood, it is the latter.
Certainly I would think that the Court would presume would not presume ill of local school districts and and even State universities, but would presume that they are complying with, if not clearly articulated law, certainly good public policy.
The second point is that what the the absence of private actions for retaliation shows is that title IX's remedial apparatus is kicking along just fine without the implied right of action.
Do we decide this case on the assumption that there was retaliation here by virtue of a complaint of violation of title IX?
Certainly, Your Honor.
We should decide it on that assumption?
You have to take as true, of course, the facts as pledged in the as pleaded in the complaint.
Another point I'd like to make briefly is about the comparison to title VII.
The other side wants you to look very closely at title VII when you're whether it's on the basis of sex or on the basis of such individual's sex, but they want you to ignore title VII and the fact that it very clearly and expressly deals with retaliation in a separate subsection, a separate provision.
And I didn't I'll have to confess I didn't hear much during the first argument.
I had my head in my own book, but what I did hear is Justice Souter referring to the the an instance in which Congress has a choice of two models for for constructing a statute, and it chooses one over the other, and isn't it a reasonable inference to allow Congress to make that choice.
That's what happened here.
Like the choice it made in 1982, very spare statute.
When Congress got to title IX, it knew about Sullivan and so it this this statute in its breadth and its simplicity bears a striking resemblance to the old pattern in 1981 and 1982 and 1983.
So if you say to me, look at the closest model, it would be that and not the more detailed civil rights legislation that came in '64 and '65.
Well, if if I could answer in two parts.
First, to say that I think what was going on in 1964 in the Civil Rights Act, obviously, you have Congress in title VII addressing itself both to discrimination and to retaliation separately; in title VI, passed as part of the same piece of legislation, addressing itself solely to discrimination.
And to use Justice Souter's analogy, in '72 Congress takes the title VI model and not the title VII model.
Now, to get to your question specifically, I think, about Sullivan is at the heart of your question, Sullivan I think there are a number of problems with the other side's reliance on Sullivan.
First, with all due respect to this Court, Sullivan itself is pretty opaque.
It certainly does not announce with flashing lights a principle that every anti-discrimination provision necessarily entails a subsidiary or corollary.
It says if you're thrown out of the club because you champion the rights of a black man, you have a right to sue under this statute.
Even if I were to grant your assumption of clarity in Sullivan, which Justice Harlan, I presume, would not agree with he was left sort of scratching his head trying to figure out what the Court was trying to do.
But even granting your assumption, if 1982 can be construed that way, that that construction does not necessarily carry over to every anti-discrimination provision.
1982, of course, uses different language to begin with and, more importantly, is is passed under Congress's power under the Thirteenth Amendment, which is the broadest conceivable.
Yes, but it did construe the word discrimination, didn't it?
No, sir.
Discrimination is not even in is not even in title rather, in 1982.
So the language is very different.
On account of race is in it.
I'll have to confess I don't it does say something like every person shall have the same right as dot, dot, dot, as white persons.
But so the the language frankly is pretty different, and the more fundamental point I'm trying to make is that even if that's true for for that statute passed under that constitutional power, here we are talking, as Justice Kennedy made clear at the very outset of the argument about a Spending Clause statute, where it is required that conditions on the acceptance of Federal funds be express, and it is not clear to me where the Birmingham Board would have gotten its clear notice in this case.
If you can imagine.
It seems to me they would get it when Congress says, and here's the statute, very spare, and agency, you get up guidelines, that any responsible school board would say, well, we've got only one sentence in the statute.
We better look at the regulations to find out what's required.
I agree, and and if and if the Birmingham Board, which I trust it did, looked to the regulation here, what it would have found is a regulation not that clarifies the substantive scope of title IX, but instead that that manages the internal operating procedures for official agency investigations.
So to be sure, the Birmingham Board was on notice that it could not retaliate in in the business of an official OCR investigation, and if it did, it would be subject to administrative enforcement, but it was it was not on notice either of the fact that there was a generic anti-retaliation prohibition, much less the fact that if it violated any such nonexistent.
But it's we're not talking about the procedure, I mean, what procedural moves.
What must you do to comply?
And it has in there you don't retaliate.
So you mean that a board could responsibly take the position, well, the the regulations tell us we don't retaliate, but when we're not faced with any agency breathing down our neck, all we have is a teacher in front of us, then we can retaliate?
I mean, they must have known the statute meant don't retaliate.
And and with respect, I think there is a difference, particularly given the clear notice requirements that this Court has has used in Spending Clause cases between retaliation in the context of an OCR investigation and retaliation generally, but I'm sorry.
I I really don't get that.
If the rule is don't retaliate and if we investigate, that's one of the things we're going that's going to be on our checklist.
But the substantive rule is don't retaliate.
Justice Stevens, may I respond?
Even granting your assumption, Justice Ginsburg, what is painfully not clear is that the is that the Birmingham Board would be subject to to a private right of action for damages and fees even in in the event that there were some generally applicable anti-retaliation provision.
Thank you, Mr.
Thank you, Justice Stevens.
Dellinger, you have about 3 and a half minutes.
I should make it clear that we're not asking this Court to create or infer a new cause of action.
We're asking the Court to interpret the cause of action that the Court itself recognized in Cannon v.
the University of Chicago, that was validated by Congress.
It was reaffirmed in the Court's opinion in Sandoval.
And when you look at the scope of that of that prohibition, that cause of action, why would it not extend to retaliation?
The idea that you.
Other statutes do it separately.
I understand.
Other statutes don't view the one as as being incorporated in the other.
The practice of Congress has not been consistent on incorporating express provisions sometimes because of language differences, but there are half a dozen major statutes that the courts of appeal have consistently assumed included retaliation as part of discrimination.
Section 1981, section 1982, title VI, 1982 as determined by this Court, parts of the Rehabilitation Act have all been construed that way.
And why would they not?
The notion that you have to admit Geraldine Cannon to the University of Chicago Medical School, you can't discriminate against her on the basis of sex, but then you could turn around and expel her for complaining about your admissions policy makes no sense.
In this case, relying upon the vagaries of what any administration might do about enforcement is not necessarily what Congress wanted, and that was this Court's decision in Cannon.
And it's reaffirmed it frankly.
There are no vagaries in private enforcement.
Private attorneys general always act in the interest of the whole polity.
There are no vagaries there.
Well, in this case, it has been known to effectuate anti-discrimination laws in order to bring them about by allowing people to step forward.
The last point they make is that even if there's a cause of action, and even if the cause of action covers retaliation, it cannot be brought by Coach Jackson because he's not also the victim of the underlying discrimination.
That makes no sense in law or in logic.
If the captain of the boys' basketball team joins with the captain of the girls' basketball team in a supportive way to say, they're just not treating girls' basketball equally and fairly, and they're both suspended from their teams or dropped from the honor society in retaliation, it makes no sense.
Either they both have they've both been discriminated against on the basis of sex because they're trying to rectify sex discrimination or neither is.
And in this case, it's going to be critically important that this valuable statute, which has meant so much for athletic and academic opportunities for women, to have people like Coach Jackson able to be confident that they've got a right that they can enforce that will allow them to come forward within the school itself and try to rectify these anomalies in and under title IX.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr.
The case is submitted.
We'll hear argument now in Antonio Dwayne Halbert v.
Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether, 42 years after this Court decided in Douglas v.
California that indigent defendants have the right to the assistance of counsel for a first-tier direct felony appeal.
Well, now, Douglas didn't involve a guilty plea, I guess.
It did not, Your Honor.
It was a trial case.
And did the Court say anything about the effect of having it be a guilty plea?
I guess it didn't.
It did not.
None of this Court's cases in the Douglas line have turned on whether the conviction was by trial or by plea.
Does that make a difference or could it?
I don't believe it does, Your Honor, because as Mr.
Halbert's case demonstrates, all sorts of difficult, technical issues can arise in a guilty plea.
Of course, certain issues are waived.
Trial issues are waived by the effect of a guilty plea, but many other issues remain.
And as Mr.
Halbert's case demonstrates, especially in the guilty plea cases this Court well knows the effect of the Federal sentencing guidelines very complicated issues of sentencing law arise.
And now Michigan has a sentencing guideline system that is perhaps more complicated than the Federal system that's been in effect since the 1980's.
Did did your client waive any right to appeal here in connection with the proceedings of the plea?
He did not waive a right to file an application for leave to appeal.
Because of the.
What did he waive?
He waived the right to have a to have what is called in Michigan an automatic appeal, in other words, the right to automatically have full briefing and oral argument.
So what he agreed to by pleading was to go through the application for leave to appeal procedure which involves a preliminary determination of merit as to whether the appeal should proceed.
Why didn't he waive the right to have counsel for that for that purpose since that was the law in Michigan?
Well, he did not first of all, as a matter of fact, he did not.
He was never told at any point during the plea proceedings that he would be giving up his right to counsel.
Well, he was told what what right to counsel he would have and it didn't include this.
He was told that under certain circumstances the judge would appoint counsel.
But the judge never said, under any other circumstances, I will not appoint counsel.
Well, isn't that a perfectly natural inference if you're told you get A and B, that C and D might have been that C and D will not be given?
It might be a natural inference for somebody with a level of sophistication, but Mr.
Halbert is a special education student, functionally illiterate.
And nobody explained to him that he wouldn't be given his right to counsel.
Well, did we take this case on the ground that he wasn't adequately advised or did we take the case on the ground that even if he were advised, he'd still have his right?
I hope the latter, Justice Kennedy, because this is a case in which the State is making a waiver argument.
And, of course, the waiver argument is not part of is not the intent of the statute.
What the statute does is it tacks on and, by the way, the defendant should be advised at the time of the plea that they won't be getting counsel.
Well, I I take it you would challenge the validity of the waiver even if he were advised?
And even if he said, I hereby waive?
Absolutely, we would because that is a waiver that is designed to extract only from the poor.
That waiver has no effect whatsoever on those with money because, in fact, a money defendant is not even eligible for appointed counsel on appeal.
So that waiver has no effect whatsoever on.
Well, wouldn't I'm I'm sorry.
It would have no effect whatsoever on money defendants I'm saying.
Wouldn't your position be different if he had been advised that he had exactly the right that you claim he has, and the court said, however, in Michigan you may not enter the the plea unless you waive that right?
If if you don't want to waive that right, which I've just explained to you, we'll we'll have a trial.
Would would your answer still be that that waiver would be as a matter of law impossible?
The waiver would be unconstitutional under those conditions because it is a discriminatory waiver.
To show how breathtaking the State's argument.
How why is that prejudicial to him?
He says, okay, I can't plead guilty.
I really did it but I can't plead guilty.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry.
Why doesn't he just have a trial?
He says, I'm not going to contest the trial.
Well, as this Court has long recognized, a trial provides very substantial benefit.
I mean, excuse me.
A guilty plea provides very substantial benefits.
And so the effect of the Michigan statute then would be only the money defendant can receive the benefits of a guilty plea and then have sentencing errors corrected.
Now, is that what you were going to say to Justice Souter, before I interrupted, that it's that it's far-reaching.
Well, not only that, if the State's waiver argument is correct, then presumably the State could extract a waiver saying you can't have free transcripts.
You can't have the waiver of the filing fees.
In fact, the State could extract a waiver saying you can't have counsel at sentencing.
These are all disparate impact arguments.
There's there's you're not making any argument that the State intentionally discriminates against the poor.
You're just saying the effect of this is harder on the poor than it is on the rich.
But I thought our our equal protection cases have have said that disparate impact doesn't doesn't hack it as far as equal protection is concerned.
Well, Justice Scalia, I actually have two responses to that.
First, this is intentionally aimed at the poor.
Looking at 770.
3a, the statute under in question here, it is clearly aimed at the indigent.
It refers to the indigent.
So this is a statute that on its face is is taking away the right of the indigent and only the indigent to have have an attorney.
So I don't agree that is is a simply a disparate impact case.
But in the context of appellate counsel for a first-tier felony appeal, this Court's cases have have not applied the same line of analysis that this Court has applied in other contexts, and I think that's quite clear most recently in the MLB case.
In any event, you pointed out that on the face there is the distinction on the face of it.
it is not a disparate impact case at all.
because it affects only indigents.
There is no question that this statute was enacted for and specifically applies only to the indigent.
It has it has no impact whatsoever on the wealthy, and it's aimed at the at the indigent only.
So I do I do not agree that this.
Whenever a State has has initially given a broad benefit to the poor, whenever it cuts back on poor on part of that benefit, it is denying equal protection to the poor?
That that seems to be an extraordinary proposition.
The State isn't picking on the poor.
It's just saying that that the the free counsel we have agreed to provide in the past we're no longer going to provide in this in this one instance of guilty pleas.
And and you say that that is intentional discrimination against the poor?
It's not a a disparate impact claim I say, because it is intentionally aimed at the poor.
The statute was designed to take away counsel from the poor and only from the poor.
So any cutback on benefits that is given on benefits that are given to the poor is intentional discrimination against the poor.
I'm not saying any, Justice Scalia.
Just this one because that's your case.
This case certainly is.
You're saying this is case like Douglas which was equal protection, like a free transcript, like a filing fee for an appeal.
You're bracketing.
This case in many ways the restrictions that are placed on the indigent's ability to appeal in Michigan, as a result of this statute, are worse than those that were struck down in Douglas because at least in Douglas the court, the appellate court, would review the entire transcript, looking for arguable issues.
We don't even have that here.
All we have here is the indigent forced to shift for himself, forced to try and determine whether there are any issues, forced to order his own transcript.
Under the Michigan statute, the indigent has to figure out how to obtain his or her docket entries, his or her transcripts, his or her prisoner account statements, all the documents necessary for filing a first appeal that would ordinarily be done by counsel.
And so.
May I just understand one point that Justice Scalia's question raises for me?
In your view, is the provision of counsel for the indigent for appellate purposes purely a matter of grace, or was there some underlying obligation to provide counsel?
Oh, it's my it's certainly my contention, Justice Stevens, that Michigan is required to afford appellate counsel in this situation for a first-tier direct felony appeal on the merits.
So that ultimately your case rests not on equal protection but due process.
It's a merger of both principles, as this Court said.
But it's one as much as the other, isn't it?
I mean, you're we're saying if you're going to provide a first appeal of right, one incident of that is, as a matter of due process, you've got to provide counsel.
Yes, Justice Souter.
So you're you're retracting the pure equal protection claim?
I don't think you want to do that.
I mean, you would say that even if there were not a due process right, you would still regard this as as directed against the poor.
It is directed.
Or not?
It is directed against the poor, which is why there is an equal protection component to this argument, but this Court's cases.
But you say that component wouldn't exist unless you begin with a due process right to have counsel on appeal.
I believe that's right.
It's it's difficult I have to confess, Your Honor, it's difficult sometimes to separate out the due process and equal protection strands from the Griffin and Douglas line, and this Court most recently in MLB said that there is a certain merger.
Also, I believe in Smith v.
Robbins this Court reiterated that there is a certain merger of the lines in these cases.
You're you're saying that the due process is what gets you beyond the stage of merely providing counsel as a matter of grace.
That's what due process does for you.
Because they have to provide counsel not merely as a matter of grace, you have a very clear equal protection case which you would not otherwise have.
Isn't isn't that the way the two work together?
I think that's right, Justice Souter.
I think I agree with that.
Can in your view, can the State require a waiver of the right to appeal for everyone?
That's a question this Court hasn't decided, and I don't have a position on that.
But that's far different from this case because that would not be discriminatory.
Well, I'm not so sure.
It certainly goes to the importance or the significance of the underlying right.
My understanding is correct me if I'm wrong that in the Federal system, we require waivers of the right to appeal frequently, even waiver of the right to appeal the sentence even before the sentence is calculated, as I understand it.
And do you question the lawfulness of that?
I don't.
And that that case has not come before this Court yet, and so I don't know how this Court would decide that case if it comes.
I know some of the Federal circuits have upheld such appellate waivers as a part of a negotiated guilty plea.
One thing the Michigan statute is does is it takes away the right to appeal effectively for indigents without negotiation.
It's it's the baseline.
But, Mr.
Moran, if if you're if you're tying your equal protection claim to a due process claim and if it is not a violation of due process to require people to waive their I mean, you can waive entirely the right to appeal.
Surely you can waive the right to counsel on appeal.
If that's not a violation of due process, then your equal protection claim dissolves.
But, Your Honor, the problem is is that the statute requires only the poor, imposes a forced waiver on only the poor.
That's an equal protection claim.
That's an equal protection claim.
But you've you've said your equal protection claim hinges on the due process claim.
If the due process claim, in turn, hinges upon waiver, then apart from the from the dispute in this case as to whether waiver occurred or not, if waiver does occur, there's no due process claim, and then there's no equal protection claim.
I'm really not sure that you can separate out the two strands of the Fourteenth Amendment again, and I know this Court didn't try in MLB, and I know this Court didn't try in Smith v.
Robbins, so that there is there is a component of both.
And it's precisely because of these sorts of questions that I think you have to view them as an integrated whole for purposes of the Griffin/Douglas line.
In any case.
Where where do we find the waiver here?
Is it in the joint appendix?
Well, it's my position there was no waiver, but the.
But you referred to something that was waived.
Where would we find that?
Well, the plea proceeding.
It's the plea proceeding.
And it's.
Well, don't take your time to look it up.
Maybe counsel for respondent can find it for us.
It's it's in the joint appendix.
All right.
beginning on page 19.
It's their argument anyway.
Let them.
I'm missing something on waiver, but I would have thought a person can waive a a right to have a counsel on appeal.
He can waive a trial.
He can waive a jury trial.
But before he has to before he decides, he has to know that he has the constitutional right to a jury trial.
That's right.
And why wouldn't he also have to have the to know that he has the constitutional right to a lawyer to represent him?
Well, that's my position Justice.
All right.
That has nothing to do with equal protection.
It has to do simply with a very common sense rule that we apply in every case, jury trial, et cetera.
So all we'd have to say is, of course, he has a right to a lawyer.
Now, if he wants to go back and waive that right, fine.
That's right.
That's all.
That's the end of it.
That's right.
So what's all this complicated thing about?
If an indigent, after being sentenced, decided for whatever reason I would prefer to go on appeal by myself, which is actually a a right this Court rejected in Martinez, that you have a right to represent yourself on appeal, but in Michigan an indigent is allowed to would be allowed to represent himself or herself on appeal if they chose to do so.
The problem here is that the statute purports to take away the right, and it's our position that this is a.
No, no.
You'd have to say the statute is wrong in taking away the right.
But he can waive it if he wants to, knowing that he has the right.
That's right.
We have no problem with a voluntary waiver.
We certainly have a problem with a forced waiver saying that you cannot enter a plea which produces tremendous benefits in Michigan, as everywhere else, unless unless you agree to waiver.
Oh, but but that happens all the time.
I mean, the waiver waiver of appeal in in guilty in guilty pleas.
That's that's not permissible either?
I take no position on that.
It may or may not permissible.
Well, you have to if you're going to make the argument you just made.
But it's far different because that's something that can be obtained in negotiation.
But what we would have.
Well, Mr.
Moran, here on page 22 of the joint appendix, the court is speaking to the defendant and says, you understand if I accept your plea, you are giving up or waiving any claim of an appeal as of right.
And you think that was not effective?
That was effective.
That that's referring to the automatic appeal that he would have if he went to trial where he would have full briefing and oral argument.
The Michigan.
Well, I it doesn't say that.
No, it doesn't.
This was a this was a pretty poor waiver proceeding in a number of of respects, but it.
Well, he does.
he does go on to say that that he can appoint a lawyer for in certain instances.
He doesn't complete the explanation by saying there are other instances and when I will not appoint one.
That he leaves out, although this a represented defendant.
Yes, he was.
He had a counsel at the plea hearing.
He did.
I'm mixed up again.
What is the answer to this?
I I would have thought that even if those words that Justice O'Connor read referred directly to the kind of appeal that we have in front of us in other words, the one that's at issue that still he'd have to know he has a right to a lawyer on that appeal before he could waive it.
Yes, Justice Breyer, I agree.
And does anybody dispute that?
I believe.
Is that at issue here?
I I believe the State might dispute that.
I'm not sure.
What the Michigan constitution does, Justice O'Connor, if I may come back to your question, is it says that for somebody who pleads guilty or nolo contendere, they are giving up the right to the automatic appeal, and they have they then have to proceed by the application for leave to appeal.
And so the Michigan constitution explicitly still provides a right to appeal, but it changes the method.
And so Michigan's appeal, after a guilty plea now, is like the first appeal in several other States, Virginia, West Virginia, and and several other States have guilty plea appeals.
That's a strange terminology.
It doesn't provide a right to appeal.
It it provides a right to apply for an appeal, a right to ask for an appeal.
A right to ask for an appeal is not a right to get an appeal.
It's framed in terms of a of a right.
Page 2 of the brief.
So you have an absolute right to ask for an appeal.
But that's not a right to appeal.
It's a right to request an appeal, which can be granted or denied.
But it's a it's what Michigan has done is it has changed the method of the appeal.
And so Virginia, for example, has first-tier appeals by petition.
West Virginia has a first-tier by petition and.
Well, it's done more than change the method.
It's changed the entitlement.
The court can simply say we're not interested in your appeal.
It doesn't raise a significant legal issue.
Yes, Justice Scalia, but that's not how the the Michigan Court of Appeals works.
The Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court.
And so in Mr.
Halbert's case, the Michigan Court of Appeals denied his appeal, after his futile attempt to to identify his issues, with an order saying that there was a lack of merit in the grounds presented.
That is a preclusive decision on the merits of his case.
That's just but that's just boiler plate, isn't it?
That's what they say in all these cases.
And I think Michigan cites a Michigan Supreme Court decision that says it's not on the merits.
It's People v.
That was a decision of the Michigan Supreme Court referring to its own orders denying applications for leave to appeal which are not on the merits.
The Michigan Supreme Court denies the applications for saying by saying, we are not persuaded that we should hear the questions presented.
Well, why wouldn't it be the same if the if it's a discretionary appeal at the intermediate appellate level?
Because the Michigan Court of Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, is an error-correcting court.
And so it issues orders saying denied for lack of merit.
And the Michigan Court of Appeals dozens and dozens of times in the last 25 years has said, without exception, that is a decision on the merits that precludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine.
Didn't didn't the supreme court in the Bulger case was that the name of it?
Didn't it say that the that the intermediate court's denial of of appeals was a discretionary judgment?
It called it a discretionary appeal, Justice Scalia, without ever explaining why, and the the dissent in Bulger pointed out the Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court.
And in fact, the very author of the.
That was a dissent, though.
That's right, but the very author of the opinion in Bulger, Chief Justice Corrigan, just 1 year later or 2 years later describes the effect of of an order denying leave to appeal in the Michigan Court of Appeals, and says it clearly shows they considered and rejected the merits.
So, in effect, it's discretionary in the sense that it's discretionary as to whether to give it full-dress treatment, but the bottom line, whether they give it full dress or or merely discretionary denial is is an implication on the merits.
Yes, exactly as in Virginia.
In Jackson v.
Virginia, the Court recognized that the the Virginia situation is exactly the same, that there is a petition to appeal to the Virginia Court of Appeals, and that each petition is considered on the merits, and a denial of the petition is seen as a decision on the merits that precludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine.
And so Michigan's appeal after a guilt plea now is exactly like the one in Virginia.
Is that something the intermediate appellate court has said?
Have they said that, that we have a a discretionary appeal, but every in every case it's a merits decision?
We don't have any decisions that say we are exercising our discretion not to review.
If a if a appeal or an application to the Michigan Court of Appeals is filed in the wrong form or is untimely or has some other defect, then the court will occasionally issue an order denying the application for that reason.
But for any properly filed application for leave to appeal, the longstanding practice of the Michigan Court of Appeals is to say it is denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented.
This means, I would presume, that that we would we would have to give our Federal courts on habeas would have to give deference to all decisions of the intermediate court since they're all on the merits.
And they do.
Federal courts do?
They assume that all factual and legal arguments have been decided against the the person applying for a discretionary appeal?
After Abela v.
Martin in the Sixth Circuit.
And there is a a whole host of Federal district court decisions in the Eastern and Western District of Michigan all saying that when an order is denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented, the AEDPA standard of review applies.
And so the State obtains tremendous benefits from this procedure.
They obtain deference on habeas corpus review.
They prevent the indigent, if the indigent were to ever get a lawyer at some later stage, from beginning relitigation on State collateral review.
And so the State very happily argues for all of those purposes that this is a decision on the merits, but then they come before this Court and they say, oh, no, it's not a decision on the merits.
It's really discretionary despite what it says because they are hoping that this Court will conclude that it is a discretionary appeal.
In fact, the State.
has made an even more radical argument in its brief.
The State maintains that the appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal, and that is plainly contrary to the to the actual function of that court because there is a provision that if trial counsel suddenly realizes in a plea case, after sentencing, that there are issues that she should have raised, it allows her to do that.
And so the State now argues that that's really the first-tier appeal, and then the application that follows after that to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal.
I'll just point out that even the State's amicus doesn't agree with that, and and rightfully so in light of Swenson v.
Bosler, which has rejected an attempt to reorganize by labeling how one's appeals go.
Moran, before your your time is up, I did want to know what is your position on let's say that there is you prevail and there is a right to counsel for these applications to appeal.
And if counsel looks at the case and determines that there is no tenable ground for an appeal, could counsel file the equivalent of an Anders brief?
Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and in fact, I have done that personally.
Before I became an academic, I worked at the State Appellate Defender Office in Detroit and was appointed to represent indigents on plea appeals.
And in a significant percentage of the cases I can't quote you the numbers off the top of my head after reviewing the case, the appellate counsel then concludes that there is no merit, that there are no grounds to proceed, that the defendant in fact got whatever it was she bargained for in the plea bargaining, at which point then either a motion to withdraw may be filed or or the equivalent, the Michigan equivalent, of an Anders brief.
And so that is done in a number of cases.
It is our position that that procedure actually helps improve the appellate process in Michigan because without that process, all you have are indigents like Mr.
Halbert, a special education student with mental disabilities, trying to identify his own issues and fall and filing, in in his case, with the help of a fellow prisoner because he could not have done it himself the help of a fellow prisoner, an application that is completely incoherent, misses several issues that are right on the face of the record, correctly asserts that his sentencing guidelines were misscored but but without explaining why, without even identifying which sentencing guidelines were misscored.
And in fact, he received a minimum sentence that was approximately three times too high under the sentencing guidelines.
The State concedes that one of the sentencing guidelines was scored in the State's favor erroneously.
We concede one of the one of the sentencing guidelines was scored in Mr.
Halbert's favor erroneously.
But then there were two others, and the most important ones, the OV, Offense Variable, 13.
That was scored for 25 points in both cases.
And so Mr.
Halbert, in fact, received a sentence that was much too high.
Michigan requires Michigan is one of the few States that requires that ineffective assistance of counsel claims be raised on direct appeal or they're lost.
And so at that point, Mr.
Halbert had to figure out a way to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel hearing, which requires an evidentiary hearing at which trial counsel must be called, assuming trial counsel is still available to be called, all from prison, and there was no possible way he could do that.
So it's not very surprising that even with the help of a fellow inmate, that his application for leave to appeal was completely incoherent.
The fellow inmate actually did write the the trial judge and say we need to have an evidentiary hearing on ineffective assistance of counsel.
But under the statute, the judge had no discretion to grant that motion.
Under the statute, only if there was already an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines, only then would the judge be required to appoint counsel, and of course, the guidelines, as misscored without objection from defense counsel there was no upward departure at that point.
If the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
Very well, Mr.
Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to start with the factual claim regarding the waiver that the Court identified, pages 22 and 23 from the joint appendix, being the point at which Mr.
Halbert, in fact, waived his right to the appointment of appellate counsel.
I think Justice Scalia is right in noting that he was told specifically it's under these conditions you'll be appointed a counsel; under these conditions, you might be appointed counsel.
From context it's unambiguous that he would otherwise not receive counsel.
And what's important is at the joint appendix on page 45, the trial court, in fact, made a factual finding on this point.
So in order for this Court to conclude that Mr.
Halbert did not waive his right to appellate counsel under the particular circumstances, you would have you would have to conclude that the trial court was clearly erroneous in its factual finding.
Well, I mean, wouldn't we have to conclude that if we're going to apply the same standards here that we usually do in in the plea waiver situation?
I mean, we the the classic point of it all is the knowing the the intelligent, voluntary waiver of a known right.
And leaving aside the equal protection problem here, even if we didn't have that, I don't see that there would be have been an adequate waiver here because he was never told that he had the right that he now claims as a matter of due process.
You indeed, dispute it.
But unless he were told that, the the waiver that that depends upon parsing the difference between must and may in the two paragraphs of explanation certainly wouldn't be taken as the predicate for a waiver of a known right.
I I think that the colloquy makes clear that he does not he's not going to have an appeal as of right, and then when told that.
Well, the the appeal of his right the appeal as of right point, as I understand it, is a different point.
What they're getting at there is it will be discretionary with the reviewing court whether your case is reviewed on the merits on some point if you ask for it.
We're here dealing with the right to counsel, and it seems to me unless he were told that he had the right to counsel that he claims and he then waived it, that there wouldn't be a an an adequate waiver under Boykin.
I think in in context when told that only under these circumstances you're going to receive counsel in bringing discretionary application, that it's clear that he is waiving in his decision to go forward with the his plea.
Look, the imagine I'm just repeating what Justice Souter said.
There must be it's so obvious that there must be an obvious answer, but I haven't heard the answer.
He knows Michigan law or his lawyer does.
The Michigan lawyer looks at the statute.
It says a defendant who pleads guilty shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review with some exceptions, which they claim are inadequate.
So he thinks the law is shall not.
I have no right.
So he doesn't not only not only is he not waiving a known right, there's nothing for him to waive.
He has no such right.
Now, obviously, when there's nothing for him to waive, how could he waive anything?
And obviously, a person who's told, hey, you don't have a right to appeal no matter what and then he says, okay, I waive my right to appeal, I mean, really.
I think that the the for the two questions that are asked, he explains the court explained to him he didn't have appeal as of right but then said.
Okay, that's the end of it.
But then and then the the.
But he had an appeal of right until he pleaded guilty.
That's right.
And that's where that's what the waiver consists of.
To say he didn't have an appeal of right, no.
That's he had an appeal of right up until the point where he pleads guilty, and that's what and that's what the judge is asking.
Do you want to do you want to plead guilty, even though if you plead guilty, you'll get you'll get a lawyer only under these circumstances.
The court didn't say only.
And that's what we're deciding is.
That's the problem.
That's exactly the issue in front of us.
Is it constitutional or not constitutional?
And waiver has nothing to do with it.
I think that I also want to make the point, of course, that there was a factual finding, so if this Court did conclude, it would have to find the trial court was clearly erroneous.
Restuccia, the we are dealing here, as is not uncommon, with someone who is learning disabled, mentally impaired, and the trial court did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal.
It said only when if this exists, I must, and if that exists, I must, but did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal.
And I was curious as a matter of what is going on in Michigan trial courts now.
Do judges routinely tell defendants who plead guilty tell them not only when the court must give them counsel, but if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal?
Because that.
that was never imparted in this case.
The advice concerning right to appeal, the one that was used in the trial court here, was a form from 2000.
The the 2004 form is available from the Michigan Supreme Court web site, and it has been modified now that because the trial court it seems apparent that he was reading from the advice concerning right of to appeal.
The way it reads now is it will say you are not entitled to have a lawyer appointed at public expense to assist you in filing an application for leave to appeal.
So this this the colloquy now would happen differently, but I think that.
Of course, your case is a little stronger than than the court just asked just saying I must appoint counsel in this circumstance and I must appoint counsel in another circumstance.
That might have left open the implication that you could appoint counsel in other circumstances, but the court went on and to say I might appoint counsel in this circumstance and I might appoint counsel in the other circumstance.
So if there's any implication from it, the implication is not just that I have I have listed all the areas in which I must, but it's also I have listed all the areas in which I either must or even may, if there's an implication.
I think I think that's right.
Well, apparently the people who who redid the model instructions thought that this would be a clearer one, to tell him up front you don't get counsel if you don't fit under these exceptions.
That's right.
And they they did they did modify the form.
So on the question of the underlying constitutionality, I want to I want to make a few points, that the the threshold question really is whether there's an appeal as of right in Michigan for a plea-based conviction.
Michigan law is clear that there is no appeal by right.
It's an application process and it's a discretionary review.
The Michigan Court of Appeals has no obligation to correct errors in these cases, has no obligation to review the merits.
Do you agree with your opponent that for AEDPA purposes, they treat the intermediate decision as a decision on the merits?
The law in the Sixth Circuit is in fact in conflict with a case an earlier case, McKenzie v.
Smith had determined that the a decision with that language, that virtually identical language, is not is not entitled to deference.
So your opponent has misrepresented Michigan law.
I didn't say I wasn't suggesting that.
Abela is one case stating one position.
McKenzie, an earlier case, stated another position.
But he says there are dozens of cases at the district court level that apply AEDPA in the way he described.
Is that wrong?
Well, he didn't cite those cases.
No, he didn't, but do you think he's wrong?
I I know that our office handles all the habeas habeas corpus.
Do you think he's wrong?
I think he is wrong.
Are you going on on record as saying that Michigan does not and will not, in the United States courts, claim any AEDPA deference as a result of one of these determinations?
The Solicitor General made that position clear before the argument before this Court in Tesmer v.
So we have not been advancing that claim.
In fact, we've been advancing a claim.
And you have not been and and Michigan lawyers have not been advancing that claim in the district courts?
The all the habeas petitions are run through the office of the Attorney General, so that the when the Solicitor General from the State of Michigan instructed our staff not to advance that claim, that means all habeas cases in Michigan essentially there will be that argument will not be advanced.
So, so far as you can tell, that's the way it's been.
That's right.
That's right.
And because there is no appeal as of right under Michigan law, this the Douglas case doesn't govern the disposition.
Ultimately the the controlling is Ross.
And the issue then is whether Michigan provides a meaningful access to an indigent defendant who wants to bring an application for leave.
That's really the I think the heart of the constitutional issue.
There are three distinct characteristics of the Michigan system.
The the nature of the review is discretionary, and I think comparable to the kind of review in Ross that was described by this Court for the North Carolina Supreme Court.
Moran makes a claim that the Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court.
With regard to applications for leave where there is no right to have the merits reviewed, it is not an error-correcting court.
In fact, one of the reasons for the legislation in Michigan, the reason the Michigan constitution was changed was because of the heavy volume that the Michigan Court of Appeals was facing.
There are 28 judges in the Michigan Court of Appeals, and they produce.
Do they all sit together?
They're panels of three.
They issue about 4,000 opinions each year.
So each judge is responsible for authoring.
But it's just one court.
One court.
That's right.
So each judge is responsible for authoring between 130-140 opinions, having to join in another 280.
So resource allocation is one of the pressing concerns in the Michigan Court of Appeals.
The situations in which the court of appeals will grant leave on application are rare.
It's it's reluctant to grant leave in these cases in part because of the.
Then why if it's just denying or not granting appeal, why does it use the boiler plate, for lack of merit in the grounds presented?
It's used that standard order for the last 20 years or longer.
The only Michigan Court of Appeals case in only published case in an application for leave setting is the Bobenal case cited by the people in our the State of Michigan in its brief, in which the Michigan Court of Appeals said there is no this is not a determination on the merits.
The only published case for Michigan in which there was an application for leave from a plea-based conviction is People v.
Berry in which the Michigan Court of Appeals, after initially having denied leave, then in a collateral attack granted leave on the very same issue and said that its original.
Why sorry.
I just had a I wanted to go back to something you said, but I want you to be finished.
Could I ask about grounds presented before we get off this?
Is it conceivable that the lack of merit in the grounds presented means lack of merit in the in the grounds of application?
Is is the applicant required to state why this particular appeal is worthy of being entertained?
They're supposed to raise those arguments.
I think that's exactly right, that merits can have different meanings, and it can it can relate to whether it would justify the resources of the court to examine the underlying merits of the claim.
I think that's right.
That's one understanding of the of the order that's consistent with the way it's been treated by the court of appeals and also, most importantly, by the Michigan constitution, when the people of the State of Michigan said trial-based convictions, there's an appeal as of right.
For all other convictions, for plea-based convictions, it would be by leave.
The Michigan's Supreme Court, in examining this very question about the nature of review, said that it was discretionary.
What of Mr.
Moran's point that this whatever the merits are, it counts as law of the case and it's it conclusively determines the issues presented?
That's not what happened in in People in the Bobenal case, which was a court of appeals published decision where the order read virtually identical identically to this one, and the court of appeals said it could would not be bound by its original denial of leave for the lack of merits on the grounds presented and reached the merits of the claim.
The same thing happened in in the Berry case in which.
Well, that was the same court, though, wasn't it?
But what what about preclusion on other courts?
In litigation in other courts.
They did did they ever say there is no claim or issue preclusion in other courts as a result of of our denials?
The court of appeals was only examining its effect on itself, and wasn't examining on subsequent courts.
And any any court, I mean, in in theory, can can revise its own its own opinions.
But the I mean, we look to preclusion really on on the effect of the judgment in another court, and I take it they have not ruled on that.
Well, but both both opinions, in Bobenal and Berry, the court said it was not a ruling on the merits.
In other words, if a subsequent court then said it was a merits determination, it would be inconsistent with the holding from Bobenal and it would be inconsistent with Berry with saying the merits have not been reached.
And they have said the same, you tell us, as to Federal courts.
The Federal courts have.
I mean, that's another court, and and they are not asserting that they've decided on the merits in Federal court.
The Federal courts have been ambiguous.
In other words, the Abela case they said.
I'm not talking about what the Federal courts have said.
I'm talking about what what Michigan has said and and what the court of has the court of appeals spoken on that subject?
The court of appeals in the Bobenal case said, in fact, examining virtually the identical language of the issue raised here, that this was not a decision on the merits and that it was not itself bound as law of the case because the merits had not been resolved.
I think the Bulger case is kind of the paramount case because it is the Michigan Supreme Court conferring the proper legal understanding of the applications for leave, and it said that the nature of the leave is discretionary.
I think that fits with common sense understanding because there is no right to have the merits reviewed.
Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense to say the application were discretionary if a defendant would have a claim to have any error corrected.
Otherwise, he would have a claim on the court of appeals.
The court of appeals has full authority to make the determination that even if everything alleged is true, it's not going to correct the error.
Look, this is what I'm I'm interested in.
It seems like Michigan is unique here.
Why not do, if you're worried about resources, what other States have done?
You just say, okay, of course, you have a right to an appeal and, of course, you have a lawyer.
We'll give it to you if you're poor.
But, by the way, if you want to plead guilty, we're not entering into that deal unless you waive it.
Well, I think that, in a way, Michigan provides a a greater protection by enabling itself.
What the court of appeals is essentially doing with its review is for the for a case where there's a an an egregious set of facts, it can reach in and grant an application and review it on the merits.
It's a it's it's a kind of a determination about resource allocation, making kind of the hard choices about policy decisions that States have to make.
Is this a case where it would meet the standard for granting leave to appeal?
This for for Mr.
Because of the error in scoring?
In fact, anyone who's very familiar with the Michigan guideline system would recognize that Mr.
Halbert, if anything, received a break in the scoring of the guidelines.
That that ultimately the Offense Variable 13 is a very easy answer to why it was properly scored.
You take the position that in fact there was no error in scoring.
The there was no error in scoring.
The Offense Variable 13 claim relates to three whether the defendant had committed three three offenses against a person within the within 5 years.
Michigan allows a determination based on preponderance even if there was no conviction entered.
Halbert was a serial child molester who admitted to having sexually assaulted his 14-year-old stepdaughter, a 10-year-old girl, a 6-year-old girl.
All that information was in the presentence investigation report.
There was no objection to the scoring of Offense Variable 13 because he admitted to the sexual assaults.
There was it was never raised.
I thought at page 36 of your brief that you agreed that he made a correct that there was an error in of application.
The Offense Variable 9 was there was an error with respect to that, but it wouldn't affect the ultimate position he would be placed in the in the brackets.
In fact, the only error that did occur that would have affected the scoring was one in his favor, which would have put him put him in a higher bracket.
So he in fact.
So there were at least two errors.
How they balance out I guess is your view they didn't hurt him at all.
Well, in fact, if anything, helped him.
But on a more basic level.
Is that correct?
There were two errors in the.
at least.
And he contends there were two more, and that hasn't been resolved.
That's that's right, but I I think those claims are.
So at at least we have to assume that it was not an error-free sentencing proceeding.
Well, more importantly, the kinds of issues at play for the sentencing cases are all like this.
They they relate to the minimum sentencing.
Michigan systems then determine from a maximum from a minimum to a maximum which will get a a range of time.
All the these sentencing guideline cases relate to the minimum sentence.
For Mr.
Halbert as a sex offender, this is really a question about when he will be eligible for release from the Department of Corrections.
He's going to be facing 30 years because all the sentences in Michigan are set by the statute.
So these oral arguments relating lesser liberty.
May I ask another question?
Am I correct in assuming from the order entered on page 43 of the joint appendix that even though there were lots of errors there, the fact that they were not raised until after December 11th would have precluded review at the trial court level?
His the point of the trial court there was that the defendant, if he wanted to withdraw his plea, should have raised that before the sentencing itself because the court has discretion before sentencing to let him out of his plea.
After sentencing, he has to show that the plea was invalid.
So his time he was untimely trying to withdraw his plea because he was concerned about consecutive as against concurrent sentences.
In in summary, the the Michigan system the with the limited date to the review and the kinds of issues from plea-based convictions that are at issue are not are lesser liberty interest questions because they have to do with amount of punishment.
The Michigan system extends the relationship of trial counsel to the defendant and asks the trial counsel to raise the motions regarding post-conviction motions which will enable him to have a factual record from which to advance his claims.
He's not left to shift for himself, that there is a counsel appointed to identify those meritorious claims.
But if the counsel happens to be incompetent, that's the end of the ball game.
And that's always the circumstance for a defendant who's bringing a discretionary application where his prior counsel was ineffective, that he can be left to identify the meritorious claims on his own and to make the argument of ineffective assistance of counsel.
That's true in Ross as well where your first where your first appeal as of right, your your appellate counsel is incompetent.
You're going to be left to identify those meritorious claims, raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, and to try to avoid procedural bars that you'll be facing.
Every system is going to have to draw that line and to say that at some point you're not going to get appointed another attorney.
Just because there's access to the system doesn't mean there always has to be another attorney appointed.
Otherwise, the point is that you would have to have two attorneys make a review on your case, whereas there is no right to an appeal here that this Court has recognized that ultimately where there since there is no right to appeal, that he had an opportunity to have a trial counsel.
But, of course, if he had had paid counsel, he would not have had these handicaps.
That's right, that the there is some advantage, but that's not the ultimate answer.
Competent paid counsel.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr.
Schaerr, we'll hear from you.
Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Like the Sixth Circuit's invalidation of this Michigan statute in the Tesmer case, petitioner's attempt to invalidate that statute here runs counter to this Court's longstanding tradition of deference to the people of the individual States and to their legislatures in the design and implementation of their criminal justice systems.
As the Court said in Coleman v.
Thompson, a case like this is a case about federalism because it involves the respect that Federal courts must pay to States and the States' procedural rules.
Respect for the State's choices is especially important here because, as the Court put it in Medina v.
California, preventing and dealing with crime is much more the business of the States than it is of the Federal Government.
And therefore, the Court said we should not lightly construe the Constitution so as to intrude upon the administration of justice by the individual States.
And and as to the question of of when to provide State-paid counsel, as Justice O'Connor reminded us in Murray v.
Giarratano, that's a choice that should be one of legislative choice, especially since it involves difficult policy considerations and the allocation of scarce legal resources.
Now, I take it that the basic rule that we've followed and this is what people are arguing about could be a criminal trial or proceeding, plea, something in a trial court.
It emerges with a judgment, and then there is going to be the first review.
Call it a leave to appeal, call it an appeal, call it whatever you want, but it is the first review.
And in those two instances, State, if the defendant is poor, give him a lawyer.
That's simple.
That's clear.
Everybody could understand it.
They may not even have a lot of legal arguments.
Now, what significant what does that prevent a State from doing that it's reasonably important for a State to want to do?
Well, again, Justice Breyer, it's a question of allocating scarce legal resources.
If you and this case is a perfect example of that.
This case is not does not involve an appeal as of right.
It involves a discretionary appeal, and and that's the vast bulk of of appeals that are addressed by the by the Michigan Court of Appeals.
So if you impose here on the State of Michigan an obligation to provide counsel in all of those cases, you are, in essence, forcing the people of Michigan to reallocate their legal resources away from other cases or you're requiring the legislature to increase taxes to pay for that to pay for that.
Is there any other State that's done it the way Michigan has?
I don't believe there's another State that's done it exactly the same way.
But I but I would point out and I think this is important, Justice Breyer that that at least according to the Michigan Supreme Court in the Bulger case, the majority of States don't allow any appeal at all from a plea-based conviction.
21 of them rule it out entirely and expressly, and another 17 effectively rule out appeals from plea-based convictions by by allowing prosecutors to impose that impose a waiver as a condition of entering into a plea.
So so the relevant universe for comparison is quite small here.
It's really 12 States at most, and and Michigan sort of fits within the middle of those States in terms of the amount of resources that it provides and opportunities that it provides.
Are you saying I just want to be clear that even if this defendant had had paid counsel, he would not have had any right to appeal to the intermediate court?
That's correct.
It it's discretionary, and that's clear not just not just from analysis of the of the Michigan courts' opinions, but from the provision of the of but from the constitutional provision that that created this entire controversy, which was added in 1994.
It's article I, section 20.
And that constitutional provision itself draws a sharp distinction between appeals of right and appeals by leave of court.
So even if the Michigan courts wanted to have a system of of mandatory appeals, they're now precluded by the Michigan constitution from doing that.
And so and so clearly, if this Court adheres to the sharp distinction and which I think is equally sharp and clear, that this Court has made between between appeals of right and discretionary appeals.
But it's not that it's not that sharp because it was in Ross, it was the second appeal.
So here we have one factor that is like Douglas, Griffin, and one factor that's like Ross.
You can't say that it falls in one camp more than the other.
This is the first-tier appeal.
I I understand, Justice Ginsburg, but but that's not the distinction that I understand this Court's decisions draw.
Several times since Douglas and Ross, this Court has said that the right to paid counsel addressed in Douglas extends only to the first appeal of right and no further.
And that's that's Coleman and and Finley, among others.
Of course, the question is whether the words, of right, were essential to that statement.
I I'm assuming that the Court was being careful in its in its choice of words, and I believe it was because that that.
Because then it wouldn't have needed to include the word first.
I'm sorry?
But then the word first was redundant, not the words, of right.
No, I don't.
You can have two appeals of right.
That's right.
I suppose if you wanted to.
That's right.
Now, so so the real question here, with regard to the right to paid counsel, is does it make sense to extend what the Court did in Douglas to this new situation.
We think it does not.
This Court's decisions, Ross and Justice Kennedy's concurrence in in Murray, as I recall, draw draw a distinction between the removal of barriers that the State imposes to the exercise of litigation rights on the one hand and, on the other hand, subsidizing, affirmatively subsidizing litigation rights And and I think this Court's care in distinguishing between appeals of right and discretionary appeals reflects a desire to cabin Douglas and and to avoid any further excursions into the area of subsidies.
And we think that's a we think that's we think that's good as a matter of policy for the Court to do that, for one thing.
May may I ask you one thing lest we forget it?
Is is your argument premised on the assumption that a refusal to hear an appeal is is not regarded as a determination on the merits and thus preclusive?
No, I don't think so.
I I think that helps the argument.
But in fact, there are lots of discretionary appeals or discretionary appellate proceedings that that do result in decisions on the merits.
This Court, for example, sometimes summarily affirms or reverses on cert, and the fact that the Court does that doesn't create.
Well, we accept cert before we do that.
I thought the question was that the denial of an application for appeal does not have any merits consequence.
Wasn't that the question?
Yes, yes.
Does the denial of an application for appeal have any merits consequence?
Well, as if if that's the question, I I would defer to to Michigan counsel.
But I'm asking whether that's a premise of your argument because the consequences of your argument are going to be very different depending on whether that is the premise or whether it isn't, whether that premise is true or whether it isn't.
I I think the distinction is is not necessarily whether the decisions are on the merits or not.
I think the distinction is between appeals of right and and appeals that are discretionary.
If it's always on the merits, it's an it's an appeal of right, it seems to me.
How can you have a a discretionary appeal which always decides the merits of the case?
Well, I in in fact, I don't think that's what happens in Michigan, and and I think the.
So your the assumption of your argument is that it is not on the merits.
, it is not a merits determination if there's a denial and hence there is no preclusion.
I I think that's true.
Whether it's an assumption of the argument, I'm not I'm not so sure.
You're talking about a piece of paper, that first piece of paper saying to the appeals court, appeals court, please hear my appeal.
And then it lists a whole lot of reasons like a cert petition.
And those are likely to do with the merits of the case.
I mean, they'll tell all the horrible things that went on.
And the question is, is he going to have a lawyer to help him with that piece of paper or not?
That's right.
All right.
Now now, it sounds to me just the kind of thing you'd write if you had an appeal on the merits too.
It's even harder.
Even harder.
You've got to convince them to take it.
It it is more difficult, but but the disparity between.
So why draw that distinction?
The piece of paper is the same, even harder to write, needs the lawyer as much, first chance he gets after the trial court.
Why draw that distinction?
Well, again, because because if you if you broaden the right to State-paid counsel, as as in Douglas, you're going to require States to to reallocate resources to that priority and away from other priorities.
Also, if you if you subsidize litigation in the name of providing adequate access to courts or meaningful access to courts, then there's going to be a lot of litigation in the lower Federal courts about exactly how much of a subsidy is necessary to reach that standard.
And also, if and this is particularly important here I think.
If you require States to subsidize the exercise of a right that they're not required to provide in the first place, like the right to seek review of a of a plea-based conviction, then you give the States a strong incentive to cut back on or eliminate that right altogether.
And and, you know, who knows?
But perhaps that's what's going on in the in the trend in the States away from providing this right.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr.
Moran, you have 3 minutes remaining.
Thank you.
I have to begin by correcting several misstatements of fact and of Michigan law.
First of all, Mr.
Schaerr just said that only a dozen States, I believe, allow for appeals from guilty pleas.
That's not correct.
Every State in the United States currently allows for appeals from guilty plea pleas.
The Bulger case did say that.
They cited a.
Appeals as of right?
Not necessarily.
As I cited in my brief, a number of States allow for applications or petitions from guilty pleas, but every State has a first- tier direct appeal from guilty pleas.
The Bulger the Michigan Supreme Court in Bulger cited a an article from an Arizona Attorney magazine that was simply incorrect on that.
Secondly, on the issue of what is the effect of a order denying leave to appeal for lack of merit on the grounds presented, the State continues to rely on McKenzie v.
Smith, an earlier Sixth Circuit opinion, People v.
Berry, and Bobenal v.
Saginaw Investment.
None of those cases uses the phrase, lack of merit on the grounds presented.
That phrase does not appear in any of those three cases.
The Berry and the Bobenal cases, those are Michigan Court of Appeals cases before 1981.
Beginning in 1981, in a series of three cases, People v.
Douglas, People v.
Hayden, and People v.
Wiley, the Michigan Court of Appeals held unambiguously that our orders denying applications or remand orders, in that case, for lack of merit on the grounds presented, was law of the case.
What's the effect of the constitutional provision then?
I'm sorry?
I I don't.
If that's so, what is the effect of the constitutional provision that Mr.
Schaerr read?
The Michigan constitutional provision?
It changes the way in which guilty plea appeals proceed.
Before 1994, there were other types of appeals that had to proceed by application for leave to appeal, primarily late appeals.
If the appeal was filed too late, it had to proceed by application for leave to appeal.
In 1994, as a result of the constitutional amendment, guilt plea appeals now have to proceed by application for leave to appeal.
That's constitutional.
We have no problem with that, and that is the method by which the caseload management problems have been solved.
They have been solved.
I I you you have the wrong one.
I meant the one that said that applications to the court of appeals are are require leave to appeal.
What's the effect of that?
The I assume you're still referring to article I, section 20 of the Michigan constitution.
It says that for the court of appeals, you need leave to appeal.
I thought they were doing something there.
What were they doing?
They were saying that first-tier felony appeals in Michigan following pleas require leave of the court, require an application for leave to appeal, like late appeals from trial cases do.
But all of those appeals are still decided on the merits with preclusive effect for law of the case purposes.
And the Sixth Circuit specifically dealt with that in in the Abela case.
McKenzie v.
Smith never never mentions anything about the lack of merit in the grounds presented.
The resource allocations point is simply that not all of these guilty plea appeals are lead to full argument and full briefing, and that's fine.
Michigan can do that.
But what Michigan cannot do, as a result of Ellis and Douglas, is for that first gatekeeping part of the appeal, which is where the court has to decide is there merit in this case, to make the indigent shift for himself.
And so in in Smith v.
Robbins, this Court, specifically referring back to the Ellis case, said that the problem that the Court identified in Ellis and that became part of the constitutional minimum in Douglas, was that the old California procedure did not require I see my time is up.
Thank you, Mr.
Chief Justice.
Thank you, Mr.
The case is submitted.
We will now hear argument in Brown against Payton.
Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: In this case, the Ninth Circuit violated AEDPA by reversing the California Supreme Court's decision affirming Payton's 1982 death sentence.
The California Supreme Court applied the exact right case, namely Boyde v.
California, in the very manner contemplated that by that decision when assessing Payton's claim that his jury misunderstood the court's instructions and, in particular, factor (k) so as to unconstitutionally preclude consideration of his mitigating evidence.
The California Supreme Court's application of Boyde is precisely the type of good faith application of Federal constitutional law to which AEDPA demands deference.
It is manifestly not objectively unreasonable, and this can be demonstrated in three aspects of the decision.
The first is that the California Supreme Court recognized Boyde's specific holding that factor (k) facially comported with the Eighth Amendment.
The second is.
Well, I thought the holding was that factor (k), standing alone, does does not raise a does does not, standing alone, raise a question of reasonable probability of of misunderstanding or misapplication of the law.
And that's not what they're claiming here.
They're claiming here that there was something much more than (k) standing alone.
As I understand it, they're claiming that the difference between this and Boyde and why this is not a standalone kind of case is that the prosecutor deliberately argued or argued law that was in fact wrong and and continued to do so even after the court interrupted the argument and that the court never gave an instruction that corrected the erroneous statements of law that the prosecutor had made.
So that's that's why they're they're saying this is not a Boyde situation.
Your Honor, Boyde has two specific components to its decision, which is, first, what factor (k) means standing alone, and you need to resolve that issue, which California did, in deciding the impact of the prosecutor's misstatements concerning factor (k).
So that, first, you start from the premise, as the California Supreme Court did, in following Boyde, that factor (k) facially directed for consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence.
Well, no, no.
The the mitigating evidence that Boyde held could be considered without a (k) being a bar, was mitigating evidence about the the character of the individual prior to or at least up to the moment of the crime.
So this is this is different kind of evidence, and I I mean, this is post-crime evidence.
And and I don't see that that Boyde's holding is so broad as obviously to cover this at all.
It might be a it would be a a closer question if it hadn't been for the prosecutor's argument and the judge's failure to correct it.
But even even without those elements, there would be a serious question whether Boyde covered this at all.
Your Honor, the respectfully I disagree.
I believe that the California Supreme Court correctly and and reasonably determined that Boyde's holding encompassed Payton's character mitigating Payton's mitigating character evidence because the holding in Boyde or the issue directly presented by Boyde was whether factor (k) limited consideration to circumstances related to the crime or allowed for non-crime related mitigating evidence in deciding the appropriate penalty.
What do we make of the Chief Justice's clear statement, not once but twice, in Boyde?
The prosecutor never suggested that background and character evidence could not be considered.
So mustn't we take Boyde with that qualification when we have a case where the prosecutor, indeed, suggested that this information could not be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor?
No, Justice Ginsburg.
First, you must assess factor (k) facially and that's what Boyde did.
Then the next question is did the prosecutor's misstatements concerning factor (k) mislead the jury to believe that they could no longer consider Payton's mitigating character evidence.
And that would be the second component of Boyde which is a general test for assessing the reasonable likelihood a jury misunderstood the instructions in the context of the proceedings.
And the particularly relevant and important inquiry in this case is the California Supreme Court's application of Boyde's reasonable likelihood test in the context of the proceedings.
Well, do we take do we take the case on the assumption that the trial court erred in not giving a curative instruction and in saying, well, this is a matter for the attorneys to argue?
You you don't argue about what a statute means.
That's a question of law.
You don't argue that.
You can argue the facts, that it's mitigating or not mitigating or that it's extenuating or not extenuating, which is I think how you can interpret a lot of this.
But it it seems to me that the trial judge does make a mistake when he says, well, well, this is for the this is for them to argue when the the point of the objection was that there was a misinterpretation of the instruction.
That's a legal point.
And that is a fact that was expressly considered by the California Supreme Court in appropriately applying Boyde's general test for whether the jury misunderstood the court's instructions and an instruction that facially called for consideration.
Not that that the jury misunderstood the judge's instruction, that there was no instruction.
I mean, the the picture that's given here is the defense attorney says, I can use this to mitigate.
The prosecutor says this is not legitimate mitigating evidence, and he said that several times.
And the judge said, well, you can both argue it, and the judge never instructed the jury.
He left it to the prosecutors to argue the law to the jury and for the jury to make that legal determination.
It it seems to me that that that is surely an error.
Now, you could still say, well, even so, it was harmless.
But but I don't think can there be any doubt when the judge tells the attorneys, you argue the law to the jury and let the jury decide what the law is?
There there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury did not take the prosecutor's statements so as to preclude consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence because the prosecutor's statements cannot.
Well, even even if even if that's argument is is on point, just taking your your response on its own terms, where do you get a reasonable likelihood?
Because the prosecutor's statements cannot be construed in a vacuum.
You have to look, as Boyde required and as California did, at the context of the entire proceedings.
What we're here what the jury was doing in Payton was deciding whether Payton should live or die, the sentencing determination.
Well, but let's get specific.
You you said there isn't a reasonable possibility.
Get get down to facts.
Why isn't there a reasonable possibility?
Why there is not a reasonable likelihood the jury misunderstood?
The prosecutor stands there and twice says, before the judge interrupts him and after the judge interrupts him says, you cannot legally consider this evidence.
It does not fall within (k), and the judge never corrects it.
Why is there not a a reasonable likelihood of of jury mistake?
One, Your Honor, the judge admonished the jury that the prosecutor's statements were that of an advocate, and that.
Precisely, if I recall and you correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought what the judge said was that the prosecutor's statements were were not evidence.
Of course, they're not evidence.
The issue isn't whether they were evidence.
They were statements of the law.
The judge didn't say anything about whether they were correct or incorrect statements of the law.
It seems to me that the judge's response to the objection was totally beside the point.
The nevertheless, the judge's response relegated the prosecutor's statements as to his personal opinion as to that of a some as as of of to argument, which is a statement of an advocate.
And the jury, from the time it was empanelled, guilt phase, and through the penalty phase, and at the concluding instructions was repeatedly instructed that they would be getting the instruction on the law from the court.
And here.
And the court didn't give them an instruction on this contested point.
I respectfully disagree.
He didn't come out and say, yes, you can consider this under (k).
He never said that.
No, but (k) says you can consider it under (k).
(k) says you can consider evidence that that goes to the gravity of the crime.
I will be candid to say I think you're stretching things about as far as you can stretch, as Boyde held, that that character evidence pre and up to the time of the crime can be considered reasonably under that factor.
But certainly evidence of what an individual did after the crime is committed does not naturally follow within (k) at all, and I don't know why any juror would consider it unless a judge came out and said flatly you can.
Your Honor, the California Supreme Court reasonably applied Boyde's holding, that factor (k) did call for consideration of character evidence, and that's precisely what Payton presented.
Well, what if we conclude that there was an error here?
Is there a harmless error argument that you fall back on?
Yes, Your Honor, there is a harmless error, but before we even get to harmless error, the fact that you disagree with the ultimate conclusion of the California Supreme Court under AEDPA is not sufficient.
May I ask.
The California Supreme Court's decision.
May I ask a question that goes sort of to the beginning?
What is your position on whether or not the prosecutor correctly stated the law?
The State concedes, and as the California Supreme Court recognized, the prosecutor misstated the law, but the jury would not.
Do you also concede he did so deliberately?
Do you concede there was prosecutorial misconduct is what I'm really asking.
Absolutely not, Your Honor.
The prosecutor did not commit misconduct.
The prosecutor made a mistake, and the misconduct analysis, which is similar to what Boyde contemplated when they set forth the general standard for assessing whether a jury would misunderstood misunderstand an instruction is is almost the same when when you're analyzing whether the question is prosecutorial misconduct.
Boyde sets forth the test for how to assess a misstatement by the prosecutor, and Boyde said that at the first instance, a statement of the prosecutor is not to be considered as having the same force as instructions from the court.
And that principle was recognized by the California Supreme Court and reinforced.
That that statement went to whether the jury was apt to accept it, not to the question of whether the prosecutor acted improperly.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
The in this case, the prosecutor made a mistake.
I don't think that there's any evidence to support the conclusion that the prosecutor committed misconduct in this case, particularly.
Well, I I can see that a a prosecutor could say, you know, this isn't factor (k) evidence, as a way of saying that this evidence is of little weight.
He did say at at one at one time, you have not heard any legal evidence of mitigation, and and that that's the troublesome part.
Your Honor, the the State concedes that the the prosecutor did make misstatements, but I think that the bulk as you pointed out, the bulk of the prosecutor's argument went to the weight to be attributed to Payton's mitigating evidence, and actually most of the argument by the prosecutor indicating that Payton's evidence didn't mitigate the seriousness of his rape and murder is there were similar arguments that were made by the prosecutor in Boyde and which Boyde found were not objectionable.
But again, the important scrutiny is that the California Supreme Court evaluated the prosecutor's statements within the correct analytical framework matrix established by Boyde.
They considered all the correct principles, the the effect of argument of counsel.
They considered the instructions, and like Boyde, they found that factor (k) facially directed the consideration.
Suppose suppose I were to take the view that it is a violation of clearly established law for a court to allow a prosecutor repeatedly to misstate the law, misinform the jury about what the law is on a life or death question without correcting that misstatement, without saying to the jury, jury, it's not for the prosecutor to argue what the law is.
I tell you what the law.
If the judge doesn't do that, then that meets any standard of violating clearly established law about which there should be no doubt that when the prosecutor makes a misstatement on a life or death question, it is the judge's obligation to say, jury, he is wrong.
You take your instruction from me and here's my instruction.
Suppose that's my view of this case.
I don't Boyde and all these other cases it just strikes me that that's clearly wrong.
What do I do with that?
Well, you can find that the court was wrong and not like what you did what the court did, but the inquiry is whether the jury misunderstood the instructions as a result of the court's conduct.
And that requires an analysis of the context of the proceedings, and that is precisely what the California Supreme Court did.
Well, now you're getting to the question I think that Justice O'Connor raised a few minutes ago about are you urging, yes, this is error, but it was harmless?
No, I am not agreeing that this was error at all.
I agree that the prosecutor made a misstatement and that the California Supreme Court thoroughly and properly evaluated that statement.
Well, but just on that point, if the prosecutor makes a misstatement, doesn't the trial judge have an obligation to correct it if it's significant?
The in this case.
Or am I wrong?
Or am I wrong about that?
The judge just kind of watches the ship sail over the waterfall?
The I mean, the the trial court did correct it.
It may not be the sufficient correction in this Court's eye, but the court did give an admonition that relegated the prosecutor's statements to that of the advocate and not to the instructions of the court.
Well, what if the prosecutor had said several times to the jury during the course of his arguments that the burden of proof by the State is by a preponderance, not beyond a reasonable doubt?
And the judge just says the prosecutor's arguments are just that, they're not the law.
I'll instruct you.
But he never says anything.
Is that okay?
It's not what we'd optimally want the court to do, but that's not the inquiry that's presented and answered by Boyde.
The question is as a result of what happened.
Trials are not error-free.
We wish that they were, but they're not.
The question is how do you respond to when a when a prosecutor makes a misstatement of law.
And Boyde addresses that question.
Well, normally we would think the trial judge would correct a misstatement of the law by counsel.
We would normally think that, wouldn't we?
And it wasn't clearly done here.
I mean, the the jury was reminded that arguments of counsel are just that.
But there was no attempt to correct what appeared to be a misstatement.
The court's admonition was sufficient.
But we're we we have to respond to the case that's before you.
What what admonition was sufficient?
The court said something about evidence and everybody I mean, there's no question what the prosecutor said isn't evidence.
But he didn't tell them he has misstated the law.
We're not talking about evidence is not at issue at all.
Neither side suggests that it is.
It's a question is what is the law that governs this controversy, what is the law that the jury must apply to make a life or death decision.
Right, and what was.
And and you.
you said the judge corrected it, and I read this joint appendix.
I could not find any correction.
The court's admonition that the prosecutor's argument was not evidence but argument of counsel relegated the statements of the prosecutor to that of an advocate and did not take the prosecutor's arguments and elevate it in place of the instructions given.
Then then it then it has another problem with it because then the judge is saying that's an argument.
Jury, you've heard arguments on both sides.
You decide.
But it isn't for the jury to decide what the law is.
But the analysis is whether there was a reasonable likelihood the jury misunderstood the court's instructions so as to preclude consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence, and that.
Did the judge instruct the jury that you are to consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial?
Yes, Your Honor, and actually that's one of the inquiries that Boyde required, is that you look at the instruction itself, the other instructions, and that's an inquiry the California Supreme Court did, in fact, conduct.
And that is, the jury was presented with with a instruction that said, you shall consider all the evidence unless otherwise instructed, and nothing out of any of the factors (a) through (k) limited the jury's consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence or precluded pardon me.
Oh, are you taking the position that as a matter of California procedure, the jury was entitled to consider matters that matter that was not within (a) through (k)?
I think that the instructions encompass the jury considering something not specifically in (a) through (k) for purposes of mitigating evidence because the instructions say, you shall consider the evidence presented, and that was Payton's evidence.
Have the California courts said that?
Have the California courts said that (a) through (k) are is not intended to be exhaustive at the pre-Payton pardon me.
Have they said that pre-Payton?
I don't think that that issue has been presented and decided by the California Supreme Court specifically.
I I thought the case was being argued to us correct me if I'm wrong on on the theory that this was factor (k) evidence.
It is our position that it it does fall within factor (k) evidence, but in deciding whether the whether Payton's jury was unconstitutionally precluded from considering the evidence, you look to the all the instructions.
And when you consider the direction to consider all that you shall consider all the evidence and then the concluding instruction.
But Ms.
Cortina, the the red brief maybe it's not accurate.
They say the instruction was all the evidence received during any part of the trial in this case, except as you may hereafter be instructed, and then that followed what the factor (k) discussion came after that.
So would it not have been possible that the jury would have thought except for the following things?
Or is there something more that I missed?
The written instruction followed the arguments of counsels.
And what and so no, there was no instruction after that.
So if they misunderstood the factor (k) instruction, they would have thought they could not consider all the evidence.
There was no reasonable likelihood that they felt that they could not consider Payton's evidence under factor (k), and the California Supreme Court.
Well, if they believed the prosecutor, they would have thought they couldn't.
But there but as analyzed by the California Supreme Court, it is not reasonably likely that the jury would have accepted the prosecutor's first few misstatements.
And as I was saying, to do so, the jury would have had to.
But all all I'm directing my inquiry to is to the significance of the instruction to consider all the evidence.
I think it's they could consider all the evidence, except that which may not be admissible, as I now or may not be relevant as I shall hereafter instruct you.
However, nothing in the following instruction says you shall not consider Payton's mitigating evidence.
No, but the prosecutor said that if you interpret the last instruction properly, you shall not do so.
He said that it didn't fall within factor (k).
However, the the jury would there is no reasonable likelihood and the California Supreme Court was not objectively unreasonable, including in concluding that the that the jury would have accepted the prosecutor's first few misstatements and chosen to disregard Payton's mitigating evidence because the jury just sat through eight witnesses testifying to Payton's post-crime remorse and rehabilitation.
They sat through that without any misstatements by the prosecutor.
So they recognized that they had heard this evidence and that it was relevant and that it was subject to consideration.
Then they heard the arguments of counsel concerning the weight to be attributed to Payton's mitigating evidence.
And although the prosecutor did make the misstatements, his statements were relegated to that of an advocate.
And to conclude that the jury would disregard the repeated instructions to follow the to take the law from the court and their inevitable, long-held societal beliefs that remorse and rehabilitation are relevant to making an appropriate moral reasoned response in deciding the life or death sentence is not a reasonable conclusion.
And we know that the fact in fact, that the jury did consider Payton's mitigating evidence by virtue of the questions that the juries the jury asked the court during deliberations.
The jury asked whether Payton would be eligible for parole and whether any change in the law could retroactively make him eligible for parole.
You only get to a consideration of whether what the effect is of saving Payton's life, under the California sentencing scheme that was existed at that time, if you believe that there's mitigation evidence to consider because California, at the time of Payton's sentencing, instructed the jury that if the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, you shall impose death.
They they might not have thought that the aggravating circumstances were entitled to to great weight.
I mean, we don't know how they evaluated the aggravating circumstances.
That might be one reasonable conclusion, but the other reasonable conclusion.
But I mean, that that is a possible conclusion, and therefore, it doesn't follow from the fact that they raised the question about life without parole that they necessarily had found that they were necessarily considering the mitigating evidence.
It's a reasonable inference to be made from the questions asked, and that's what you're looking at.
It's it's one possibility.
Isn't that all?
It's one reasonable inference, and that's what's the important inquiry, is that the trial the California Supreme Court reasonably considered the relevant, pertinent facts and all the applicable law in reaching a decision that Payton's jury was not unconstitutionally precluded from considering his mitigating character evidence.
And I think that that the California Supreme Court's decision demonstrates that it applied Boyde to the letter faithfully and methodically, and that it it considered all the relevant facts and that its decision under these circumstances is manifestly not objectively unreasonable.
And that is the requirement, and that is the inquiry that we're here today to resolve.
The the Ninth Circuit failed to give the appropriate deference to the California Supreme Court's decision in deciding that the penalty should be Payton's penalty should be reversed.
And the Ninth Circuit instead conflated objectively unreasonable with a determination that it personally felt that there was constitutional error and doesn't respect the distinction recognized in AEDPA between a incorrect decision or a correct decision, incorrect decision, unreasonable decision, and the higher threshold of objectively unreasonable.
And unless this Court has any further questions, Justice Stevens, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.
How long did the penalty phase take?
The penalty phase took about a day with eight witnesses.
Thank you.
Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start off, if I may, by addressing some of the points that were brought up just earlier, and I'd like to indicate to this Court that the California Supreme Court has held that factors (a) through (k) are the exclusive considerations that the jury must encompass in deciding whether or not to impose death or life.
Has factor (k) been supplemented with a CALJIC instruction since Payton?
It has.
In 1983, 2 years after Payton's trial, it was supplemented to include all of the mitigating evidence that this Court has indicated the jury is entitled to consider.
But what is important.
Excuse me.
Do they still call it factor (k) or do they just have a supplemental instruction that follows factor (k)?
It's been a couple of years since I've done a death penalty trial, but I think it's still called factor (k).
It's just supplemented and changed that way.
The second thing is that this Court has indicated some concern over the jury question that was raised first in in the State's reply argument.
And I need to put the Court, I think, in in proper context as to what occurred in in that jury question.
The case was given to the jury at 11:55 on the date of of the determination, and the jury was told to select a foreman.
5 minutes they went into the deliberations room.
5 minutes later they came out and went to lunch.
They didn't commence their deliberations thereafter until 1 o'clock.
At 1:10, they came out with a the question that is now before the Court.
And I want to suggest to this Court that it is not reasonable to believe that during that 10-minute span of time the jury considered the whether or not factor (k) applied.
And what was the question?
The question there were really two questions.
One and I'm paraphrasing is there any possibility Mr.
Payton could be released on parole if we give him life, and the second one is if the law is amended, could that be construed to be retroactively applicable to Mr.
Those were the two questions.
Those don't sound as if they thought his conversion to Christianity made a difference.
I think, Your Honor, what the jury articulated is what this Court has seen on many occasions, the jury's concern about does life without possibility mean life without.
They never went beyond that at this point in time.
So what I'm suggesting to this Court is that the short span that they had to write that question, which I agree, given enough time, might permit an inference that they did consider factor (k), isn't applicable in this case.
Well, an equal inference is they just felt that it was entitled to no weight at all given the horrific nature of this of this crime.
Yes, I agree.
And my position isn't that that the short span of you know, assists our position.
Our position is that this won't assist this Court in arriving at a decision about whether the jury considered it.
And you have to show there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury might have come to an opposite conclusion.
And Boyde teaches that the way to do that is to look at the context of the entire case in conjunction with the the instruction that was given in this case.
And I want to start out that I I agree with the State that the first thing this Court should do is look at the instruction standing alone.
And I want to indicate that without reference to the context of the case, the instruction standing alone does not support the inference that Payton's post-crime evidence could be considered.
Now, I agree that in the context of the case, the context of the case could change that consideration.
For instance, if the court, as this some member of this Court already indicated, told the jury that factor (k) is to encompass Payton's evidence, or even if the prosecutor may have said to the jury during his argument, ladies and gentlemen, although it might not seem like Payton's evidence could be considered by you under factor (k), in fact it can, then we would be left with a situation very similar to Boyde where there really is no argument among counsel as to whether or not the evidence could be subsumed under (k).
And that, in the context of that case, would permit it.
Well, on on that point and I I recognize it's it's not nearly as clean as the hypothetical you present he did say this is the prosecutor.
The law in its simplicity is that if the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors, the sentence should be death, and so let's just line these up, and then he talks about the the conversion.
So there were other parts of his argument that indicated by one interpretation this is not mitigating under special (k) under factor (k).
But here he does say that you line that up and you weigh one against the other.
I I would respond to that by saying two things.
He does say that, but after he says, ladies and gentlemen, I want to address some of of Payton's evidence.
I'm not suggesting and I'm and I don't believe that it applies under factor (k).
But then he went on to discuss that evidence.
And I agree he did.
I certainly can't say he didn't.
But but the real issue here is what effect likely did that have on the jury, and I I'm indicating that that given the preliminary his preliminary part about it still doesn't apply but I will address it, that is unlikely to give the jury any confidence that that evidence could be considered.
So it's not at all a concession that occurred in this case whatsoever.
Well, why wouldn't the jury conclude why isn't it the most logical conclusion that, gee, the judge had us sit here through eight witnesses and listen to all that and he didn't exclude any part of it, so of course we must consider it because otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to all of it?
That was a relevant consideration in Boyde and I think a powerful consideration in Boyde and in California v.
Because of the context of this case, it's not relevant here.
Once the judge permits both counsel one counsel to argue one way and the other counsel to argue the other way, the jury is now being relegated as the the finder of the law.
In order to evaluate whether or not they could consider that evidence, they had to look at the evidence that was presented.
Well, they they always have to say whether or not we're going to really weigh this or is it just too tangential, and that's one way of saying, well, this really isn't mitigating.
And we know as lawyers that it is mitigating in a sense that is that is relevant and that it's there for the jury to give it the weight that it chooses.
But jurors say, well, you know, this this just is not important is what they're saying.
Well, when the prosecutor says this doesn't fall under (k) and the defense attorney says it does fall under (k), all I'm indicating is that the argument that this would be viewed as a charade no longer has any effect.
It is now a preliminary thing that the court that the jury must look to.
Well, it's a shorthand for saying it doesn't fall under (k) because it just is of so little weight.
Now, that's I think how the jury might have interpreted it.
Yes, Your Honor, they might.
But the issue here is whether or not there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury did not consider that, and and that's.
Actually that isn't really the issue.
I think I find that easy.
The harder issue is is whether the a person who thought about it differently than me, a judge, would have be objectively unreasonable.
At least for me, that's the hard question.
The question you're arguing is not hard.
I don't think I understand Your Honor.
I mean, I would perhaps have come to a different conclusion than California Supreme Court on that question, but we can overturn them only if they're objectively unreasonable.
And that's that's the hard thing because for me.
I there is very relatively little guidance that we have so far on the AEDPA.
I think the the cases that do have some relevance are both Wiggins v.
Smith and Taylor v.
Wiggins v.
Smith dealt with the failure of the State court to actually evaluate evidence that occurred in this case.
The California Supreme Court opinion on the issue of whether or not the the court properly conducted itself has one sentence, and the sentence says and I'm paraphrasing something to the effect of the fact that the court refused to adorn factor (k) is not in itself a an error.
Well, we all, I think, would would concur that that's true, but that doesn't address what happened here.
It's a complete failure to address an all-encompassing event that happened, something close and I have to be careful here something close to structural error where the judge gives over the obligation to decide what the law is to the jury.
The California Supreme Court not once ever considered that, and there is no reference to them doing anything other than making that one.
Well, no, but I mean, that's that's really wrong what the judge did.
But but the that that's tangential to the question.
The question is, is it reasonably likely, if that hadn't occurred, that the jury would have considered the evidence that he was converted?
But since it did occur, you know, they they didn't consider it.
Is it reasonably likely they never considered it?
That's that's the question.
And then I can imagine, for what reason that Justice Ginsburg said, myself sitting in the California Supreme Court and saying, well, they heard the evidence for 2 days or a day, six witnesses, eight witnesses.
They're not technicians, the jury.
And and of course, they considered it.
I can imagine that and that's why I'm having even though I don't agree with it.
Considered I agree.
They certainly considered the evidence, but they also, if they were following their obligation under the law, they considered whether or not they were entitled to give that any weight under factor (k).
That was the primary function that was given to them.
So certainly they discussed the evidence, but then did they arrive did they go in that room and arrive at a decision that maybe we can't by law consider this evidence?
And I think that's the focal point here and that's the thing this Court doesn't know what happened in that jury room.
Except if they heard so much of the evidence, isn't it unlikely that the jury thought they couldn't consider what they heard?
The more evidence they hear, the more likely it is I think that human beings are going to consider the evidence.
The evidence the the penalty evidence took place over a 2-day period of time, but I want to indicate that it took place over two half-day periods of time, and that if you put the time together, I think it comes to around 70 pages, which should be substantially less than a half-day altogether.
Now, it encompassed eight witnesses, and there was a lot of evidence brought out about post-crime conduct.
But it it wasn't a massive amount such as there was in Boyde, 400 pages and weeks of testimony.
So I think that that's a a an important consideration too.
The the Court's concern about whether or not the jury would likely consider that, it seems to me, starts with the an examination of of factor (k) itself.
And and I want to indicate that Mr.
Payton really didn't start out at the same mark as as the State did in its case.
The language of factor (k) just doesn't on its face appear to permit consideration of that evidence.
And and so, therefore, something had to have happened in the trial, we assert, to change that, to make the ambiguous, at least as applied to Payton, evidence of factor (k) applicable so that the jury would reasonably likely consider it.
The events that could have happened during the context of that trial didn't happen.
In fact, everything happened against the defendant.
He starts off with an instruction that's against him that supports, under any natural reading, the prosecutor's language, and then he's buttressed with a prosecutor that given the plain and natural meaning of the language, is going to have a far more compelling position with the jury about whether or not it could be considered.
And the and the defense attorney's position is really nothing more than an assertion, when he looks at the language itself an assertion that it was awkwardly worded.
Now now, the defense attorney made reference to if this was the kind of evidence if I was a juror and I was considering this, I would think this would be important evidence.
And the answer to that is of course, it is important evidence, but that's not the question.
The question is whether or not it could be considered under (k).
He gives he, the defense attorney, gives his position that that (k) was meant to be a catchall factor and it was meant to consume and take into effect Payton's evidence, but he had nothing to support that.
He had no legal position to support it.
He was faced with the plain language of the statute that didn't permit him to do that.
Doesn't it?
I mean, it it says that what's what's the exact language of that statute?
I just had it here.
It's it's gravity.
It's the.
It is any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime.
Of the crime.
You could say it.
Yes, his his later conversion extenuated the gravity of the crime, not the not the when I try to think of this person, who is not me, thinking of that, I say, well, plausible.
Plausible, not perhaps the best, but plausible, isn't it?
Well, as we pointed out in our brief, this Court in in Skipper some Justices in in that decision indicated that well, in fact, the majority indicated that the post-crime evidence of rehabilitation in prison is, in fact, not anything that relates to culpability.
Factor (k), however way you look at it and I agree that it's sufficiently ambiguous to where, given the right context, the right events happening at trial, a jury would reasonably likely look at it as covering that.
But not under this case, though, because there wasn't anything that happened in Payton's trial which permitted a reasonable inference that in fact that evidence should be considered.
And as to harmless error, I as we pointed out in our brief, it under the California statute, which in effect requires that if the aggravating evidence outweighs the mitigating evidence, the jury shall return a verdict of death, if there's no reasonable likelihood that the jury considered factor (k), then in effect Bill Payton was left without any mitigating evidence to be considered by the jury at all.
And that means that the jury had to come back with a verdict of death.
Now, that brings this Court, once the Court if the Court becomes satisfied as to constitutional error, that brings the Court, I think, very closely to to this case this Court's case in Penry v.
Johnson because there the jury will not have had a vehicle in order to give effect to Payton's mitigating evidence.
In Penry v.
Johnson, in fact, in discussing at least the Eighth Amendment issue, this Court never really even discussed harmless error.
It was reversed without any discussion.
Now, I don't want to suggest the Court didn't engage in a harmless error.
I I see where you're going, and I I see that there's some parallel.
The problem in Penry was that the jury the jurors had to actually violate their instructions, and you have to escalate your argument a bit before you get to that point.
Yes, I I agree.
It's not exactly identical, but we're very close to to that point in Penry.
Beyond that, the prosecutor did argue vociferously that the jury should in its determination, should be concerned about whether or not Bill Payton is going to stab the prison guards in the back, in effect, argued dangerousness, which was appropriate.
But if the jury he also argued that the jury couldn't consider evidence which plainly pointed to his lack of dangerousness, his good adjustment in prison, his conversion to Christianity.
So, in effect, the prosecutor was able to argue its side and and the jury wasn't able, when you get to the harmless error analysis, to argue its side.
And that's what makes this, it seems to me, a very strong showing that that harmless error that the error in this case is not harmless.
It had a clearly important effect.
Is it relevant at all?
This happened 24 years ago.
We're sitting here trying to think of what a jury would have been thinking in a state of the law that's a quarter of a century old and facts I don't know what to think.
I guess that's just irrelevant?
Well, it's certainly relevant to Bill Payton, and and I don't demean the position of the Court.
It's not relevant in terms of its impact as to future cases.
There are some cases left that are still dealing out there, dealing with factor (k).
The best our knowledge, we've we've done a search and we believe there is about 70 cases dealing with the old, unadorned factor (k), but of those 70 cases, none of them from and we haven't reviewed all of them, but of the ones we've reviewed, none of them deal both with Payton's pure post-crime evidence, coupled with the prosecutor's unrelenting position to the Government that they cannot consider that evidence.
